\subsection{Generated Expressions}
\seclabel{generated}

If a subexpression of a \KWD{do} expression has type \TYP{()}, the
expression may be followed by a `\EXP{,}' and a generator clause list
(described in \secref{generators}).  Writing ``\EXP{\VAR{expr},
\VAR{gens}}'' is equivalent to writing ``\EXP{\KWD{for}\mskip 4mu plus
4mu\VAR{gens} \KWD{do}\mskip 4mu plus 4mu\VAR{expr} \KWD{end}}''.  See
\secref{for-expr} for the semantics of the \KWD{for} expression.  Note
in particular that \VAR{expr} can be a reducing assignment of the form
``\EXP{\VAR{variable}\; \mathrel{\OPR{OP}}= \VAR{expr}}''.
