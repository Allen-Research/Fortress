A \KWD{do} expression consists of a series of \emph{expression blocks}
separated by \KWD{also} and
terminated by \KWD{end}.  Each expression block is preceded by
an optional \KWD{at} expression (described in \secref{parallelism-fundamentals}),
an optional \KWD{atomic}, and
\KWD{do}.  When prefixed by \KWD{at} or \KWD{atomic}, it is as though
that expression block were evaluated as the body expression of an \KWD{at} or
\KWD{atomic} expression (described in \secref{atomic}), respectively.
An expression block
consists of a (possibly empty) series of \emph{elements}--expressions,
generated expressions (described in \secref{generated}),
local variable declarations, or local function declarations--separated
by newlines or semicolons.

A single expression block evaluates its elements in order: each
element must complete before evaluation of the next can begin, and the
expression block as a whole does not complete until the final element completes.
Each expression except the last element of the expression block
must have type \TYP{()}.
There are two ways to make an expression \VAR{e} of type non-\TYP{()}
have type \TYP{()} in an expression block:
1) ``\EXP{\VAR{ignore}(e)}'' and 2) ``\EXP{{\tt\_} = e}''.
If the last element of the expression block is an
expression, the value and type of this expression are the value and
type of the expression block as a whole.  Otherwise, the value and
type of the expression block is \EXP{()}.  Each expression block
introduces a new scope.  Some compound expressions have clauses that
are implicitly expression blocks.

Because a local declaration shares a syntax with an
\emph{equality testing expression}, we require that any equality testing
expression within an expression block be parenthesized.


Here are examples of function
declarations whose bodies are \KWD{do} expressions:
