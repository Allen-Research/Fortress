\chapter{Type Inference}
\chaplabel{type-inference}

\note{This chapter will include the Fortress static type inference mechanism.}

\note{ \begin{itemize}
 \item
 There seems to be a circular dependency between inference and juxtaposition
 disambiguation -- you have to know if the subexpressions have arrow types
 to disambiguate, but you can't do that without using inference, which
 requires knowing how the variable of unknown type is used.
\item Type Inference (Dan's email titled ``Comments on a first reading of the spec'' on 06/05/07)
\item Do we want to forbid such cases where type inference infers
\TYP{BottomType}s for static parameters?
 \end{itemize}
}
