DATA FILES

SOURCE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY (SPEC_HOME/Data)

bnf.txt: an ASCII source file containing the BNF grammar for Fortress
fortress-keywords: a list of Fortress keywords
fortress-specialReservedWords: a list of special reserved words
fortress-unitOperators: a list of operators on physical units

In each of the last three files, words are listed one per line in
ASCII lexicographic order (that is, alphabetic order, but all capital
letters precede all lowercase letters; thus "BIG" comes before "atomic").
