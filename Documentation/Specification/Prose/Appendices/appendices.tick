\appendix
% \newpart{Appendices}{appendices}

% We might want this to be several parts: 
%  - Language details
%     - grammar(s)
%     - detailed lexical structure, including ASCII encoding, various tables (e.g., operators)
%  - Foreign function interface (esp. with respect to Java)
%  - Future features
%      - dimensions and units
%      - regions/locality
%  - Tools
%      - Pretty printing (e.g., Fortify)
%      - Linker, etc.
%  - Formalization (i.e., calculi)
%  - Implementation/system issues (i.e., running on JVM)
%  - Differences from previous versions

% Arguably, "libraries" should also be an appendix.

% The following should perhaps be a single appendix.
