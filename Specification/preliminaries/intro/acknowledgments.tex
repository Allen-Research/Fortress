and the many other participants in the Fortress community.

We would also like to thank the anonymous referees of peer-reviewed
papers related to the Fortress project, who have influenced the
language design in many ways, as well as the DARPA reviewers from
the HPCS project for their thoughtful feedback throughout the
design of the language.
