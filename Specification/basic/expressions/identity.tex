\subsection{Identity}
\seclabel{identity}

An identity function \VAR{identity} is defined in \library:
%% identity[\T extends Any\](x: T) = x
\begin{Fortress}
\(\VAR{identity}\llbracket{}T \KWD{extends}\mskip 4mu plus 4mu\TYP{Any}\rrbracket(x\COLON T) = x\)
\end{Fortress}
The function returns its argument as it is.
