\subsection{Ignoring Values}
\seclabel{ignore}

For convenience, the function \VAR{ignore} (equivalent to the
\texttt{ignore} function in the Objective Caml programming language) is
included in \library:
%% ignore(x: Any) = ()
\begin{Fortress}
\(\VAR{ignore}(x\COLON \TYP{Any}) = ()\)
\end{Fortress}
The function discards the value of its argument and
returns \EXP{()}.  For example, the following:
\marginnote{
I manually added space between $f$ and $x$
-- Sukyoung}
%ignore(f x)
\begin{Fortress}
\(\VAR{ignore}(f\ x)\)
\end{Fortress}
is equivalent to:
\marginnote{
I manually added space between $f$ and $x$
-- Sukyoung}
%do f x; () end
\begin{Fortress}
\(\KWD{do} f\ x; () \KWD{end}\)
\end{Fortress}
