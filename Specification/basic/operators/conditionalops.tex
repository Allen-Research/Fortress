\section{Conditional Operators}
\seclabel{conditional-operators}

If a binary operator other than `\txt{:}' and `\txt{::}' is immediately followed by a `\txt{:}'
then it is \emph{conditional}: evaluation of the right-hand operand
cannot begin until evaluation of the left-hand operand has completed,
and whether or not the right-hand operand is evaluated may depend on
the value of the left-hand operand.  If the left-hand operand throws
an exception, then the right-hand operand is not evaluated.


\Library\ define several conditional operators
on boolean values including \EXP{\wedge\mathinner{\mathtt{:}}} and
\EXP{\vee\mathinner{\mathtt{:}}}.

\See{conditional-operators-impl} for a discussion of how conditional operators
are declared.
