\section{\basiccore}\label{basic-calculus}

In this section, we define a basic core calculus for Fortress.
We call this calculus \emph{\basiccore}.
Following the precedent set by prior core calculi such as Featherweight
Generic Java~\cite{fgj},
we have abided by the restriction that all valid \basiccore\ programs are
valid Fortress programs.
