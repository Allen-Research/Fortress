This directory contains the master file for the Fortress language
specification, along with an accompanying build script, helper scripts,
and some machine-generated helper files. 

To build the specification, call, you must have Ant installed, and you must 
set FORTRESS_HOME, so that Ant can locate the interpreter, fortify
tool, and libraries. Once FORTRESS_HOME is set, you can build the spec
by typing "./ant tex". Doing so will cause all machine-generated
helper files to be regenerated, and for the specification to be
recompiled. 

To regenerate all machine-generated files, without recompiling the
spec, call "./ant genSource".
