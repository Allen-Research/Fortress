I wrote this example for people that just want to try the tool without having a preexisting document.

I used the fortify tool to generate latex for the run method in buffons.fss, producing
the output buffons.tex.  I edited that to add the following header:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fortify}

\begin{document}

and the following footer:

\end{document}

and saved the file in buffons.tex.  

I copied ../fortify.sty to this directory and then ran pdflatex on buffons.tex to generate buffons.pdf.

Alternately, you can run the commands:

../../bin/fortify buffons.fss
pdflatex buffons_doc.tex
