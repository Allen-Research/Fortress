# copy modifications to local_repository/configuration,
# or set per-user properties in $HOME/.fortress/configuration, 
# or set per-directory properties in .fortress/configuration.
#
# Properties can also be specified as environment variables (replacing lower.case with UPPER_CASE).
#
# They can also be specified at the command line. For example:
#
#   JAVA_FLAGS="-Dfortress.caches=/tmp/fortress_caches" fortress run somefile.fss
#
_fr=${FORTRESS_AUTOHOME}/ProjectFortress
# 
# Note the reference to _fr itself, to allow pickup of FortressLibrary.fss
# 
# FORTRESS_AUTOHOME is set by consulting (in order):
#   property fortress.autohome
#   environment FORTRESS_AUTOHOME
#   the existence of ../ProjectFortress from java.class.path (add /..)
#   the existence of ../../ProjectFortress/build on java.class.path (add /../..)
#
# Note the prefix ";" -- that sets the separator for this path to ";", which works
# on Windows.  ":" fails in Windows because of DRIVE: prefixes.
# Fortress.repository.paths is used to find search for any fortress repository,
# which will be used to cache files.  It is possible to read the configuration from
# one place, and write cached files to another -- just be aware of this.
