(** `StandardMinMax` combines MIN and MAX operators, and provides a
    combined MINMAX operator.  This operator returns both its
    arguments; if equality is possible, self should be the leftmost
    result.  This effectively means that `(a MINMAX b)` stably sorts
    `a` and `b`.  In addition, `a MINMAX b = (a MIN b, a MAX b)` must
    always hold. **)

trait StandardMinMax[\T\]
        comprises T
    opr MINMAX(self, other:T): (T,T)
end

(** StandardTotalOrder is the usual total order using <,>,<=,>=,=, and CMP.
    Most values that define a comparison should do so using this.
    Minimal complete definition: either CMP or < (it's advisable to
    define = in the latter case).  The `MIN` and `MAX` operators
    respect the total order and are defined in the obvious way. **)

        extends { StandardMinMax[\ StandardTotalOrder[\Self\] \] }
