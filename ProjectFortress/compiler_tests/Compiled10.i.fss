(*  A trait 'T' is eligible to extend trait 'U' if either:
 *   1) the declaration of trait 'U' has no 'comprises' clause, or
 *   2) trait 'T' is a subtype of (and perhaps the same as) some trait
 *      mentioned in the 'comprises' clause of 'U', or
 *   3) trait 'T' has a 'comprises' clause, and every trait mentioned
 *      in the 'comprises' clause of 'T' is eligible to extend 'U'.
