 I can't help myself. I have to keep this discussion about blogging
 going.  Is blogging just the end result of someone's input into a
 Content Management System. Of course it is. So what. You could point a
 URL to a daily post in a discussion forum. It would have far better
 interactivity than a blog, and would be just as easy to post as often
 as the author would like. Does that make the output purely a forum post
 ? Or for those old school among us, putting up a page on a website
 could be a blog, a column, a report, whatever. The manner of how you
 post something to the web is not even worth discussing. A blog is a
 blog is a blog.  If you blog, regardless of what software you use, you
 are a blogger and what you produce is a blog. If you want to call
 yourself a columnist, so be it. If you are a reporter in a 1 page
 internet only publication, yes you are.  From there, only one question
 comes up. Why. Why ? Why do you do what you do. Is it because: You get
 paid to do it ?  Because you want to promote something or to promote
 yourself ?  Because you want to start a discussion ?  Because you want
 to communicate with customers, fans or ??  Because its a way to say
 whats on your mind ?  Because you want to make money from it ?  I'm
 sure there are other reasons to communicate on the web. What software
 you use, even whether you use video, text and/or pictures, really
 doesn't matter.  What matters is why you do what you do.  For most of
 us, we start on the furthest reaches of the long tail of all content.
 To make money from whatever it is we produce is not only difficult, its
 near impossible. To get off the long tail is near impossible as well.
 Only a few will ever find their way to a point of generating enough
 consumers of our content to have any choice in whether we monetize or
 influence a material number of people. Others of us will still be in
 the long tail, but have influence in a small verticial segment
 important only to those who already know us, or come to know us. Its
 possible to be a big player in a small pool, and get paid for it,
 still reside on the long tail.  The hope by all on the longtail is that
 the "quality" of the publication will garner enough consumers to move
 them off.  Like the artist whose art is better, the band or musician
 whose music is better, the producer, director or actor whose video is
 better. Everyone hopes that quality of content is the final arbiter of
 attraction and success.  The worst part of it all is that when you are
 on the long tail, it takes a lot of money or luck to get off and
 99.99pct , never get off. Which is exactly the definition of the
 longtail.  Thats for individuals.  For corporations who publish on the
 web (as opposed to aggregate 3rd party content), again, regardless of
 what content management software they use, or what they call
 themselves, the longtail is death.  If you are a blogger, and you work
 for a major media company, you are born with a silver spoon in your
 mouth. You are granted a platform with traffic. Thats the good news.
 The bad news is that you also have ratings. If you can't hold your
 traffic or build upon it, you better hope you generate sufficient value
 in other places, or your days of publishing on the web may be numbered.
 For those of you who haven't noticed, paid bloggers do come and go from
 media websites if they don't produce. But wait, there is worse news.
 The media companies that have traffic foundations and can dual purpose
 people so that they can publish off line and online come with their own
 set of problems. They are paddling as fast as they can to retain their
 offline businesses. Newspapers, to continue to use them as an example,
 are pushing as hard as they can to sell papers and retain advertisers.
 For those who think that a newspaper is just like a newsletter, you
 have never been a paperboy.  To try to maximize online traffic and
 resultant revenue, newspapers turned to blogging. Saul Hansell of the
 NYTimes commented that blogs are used uniquely and thoughtfully by
 NYTimes reporters to communicate new information and create discussion.
 That's great.  It's a way for the paper to drive readers to their
 website, keep them as readers and hopefully add more readers. It's
 using whatever content management system they use to give more value to
 readers. Wonderful.  Unfortunately for them, they are now in the same
 old grind that they are in with the newspaper business. Their articles,
 I mean blogs, vs everyone elses' blogs. They hope that readers believe
 that their content is better and that brings them back. They hope like
 the new TV show following the hit, that they can retain audience.   An
 approach which puts them on the exact same content treadmill   as even
 the smallest blogger. . For some on the NYTimes website, as with any
 and every other newspaper website, they will manage to stand out from
 the crowd. The majority will not. They will bump their way down to
 where everyone else is. Such is the nature of the content business. No
 matter what anyone at the NY Times thinks.
  That is the endgame I see for newspapers that publish complimentary
  content on their website. You can call it blogging. You can even call
  it something else. The point I didnt make clear enough in my previous
  post, is that it has to be something else.  No matter the quality of
  the writer, its just another stab at an audience in a medium where
  there are no barriers to entry. Its just one more example of the
  newspaper business following everyone else onto the web and doing
  exactly what everyone else is doing, but expecting they will be better
  because they are "The big paper".  Thats a huge mistake.
 Call me crazy, as many out there have, but I would have made every
 effort to be different in a way that leverages brains, technology and
 size. I would have sat down and tried to figure out the answer to the
 question "What leverages our strengths and pre empts every blogger out
 there so that people perceive blogging as the low end and our
 presentation as the future of the medium" You wouldn't have to get it
 right out of the gate, but you could send a message that you are
 striving for more and those with "merely a content management system
 for blogs" will not be able to do what you do.  This is the bias that
 comes from 25 years in the technology business. A feature that anyone
 can add is not a sustainable differentiation. Since you can easily add
 it anytime, like everyone else, instead, always look for what can set
 you apart and pre empt the competition Or you can following the pack.

There was a lot of discussion about my previous posts here and here. My
point is that the internet is a stable platform. Its a utility. Its
evolved to the point where you can count on it and develop applications
for it without much fear that its going to change.  What confirms my
point is that with all the talk of a possible or existing recession, not
a single mention is ever made about how increases in productivity from
technology will pull us through. That is counter to the recessions of
the past 25 years. Whether it was the early 80s, the 90's or even the
post bubble , economists and others pointed to technology as a catalyst
to productivity that would help pull us out of our economic doldrums.
When there were boomtimes , as we saw from about 91 to 2000, technology
was given the lions' share of the credit.   So where are the claims of
further productivity enhancements from technology ? They are no where
that I can find.  In fact, we can start to make arguments to the
contrary. That technology and in particular social network and video
sites can be a hindrance to productivity in the workplace.   Further
arguments can be made that the MSFT YHOO potential merger is further
evidence that the technology industry is maturing.  It is what it
is.Permalink | Email this | Linking Blogs | Comments
 Sometimes we come across Reader-related things that are interesting
 enough that we'd like to post about them on our blog, but at the same
 time too small to base
a whole post around. Enough of these tidbits have piled up to build a
whole meal, so we thought we'd just share them with you, one link at a
time.

Video Appetizers

 Reader is centered around subscribing to feeds, but it's not always
 easy to explain to others what feeds are, who makes them, and why you'd
 want to subscribe to them. Worse yet, sometimes they're "feeds" and
 sometimes they're "RSS" -- and what is this "Atom" thing anyway? This
 RSS in Plain English video does a good job of explaining all that, in a
 very unique style.

 Also on the topic of videos, Chris made a short clip showing all the
 places he's used his offline Reader. If you or anyone you know would
 like to know just why you'd Google Gears-enable an application, this
 showcases it pretty well:



 For a more in-depth discussion of Gears and Reader, you can watch Aaron
 Boodman's presentation from Google Developer Day.

Embedding Entrées

 Many folks like our gadget, but sometimes wish even more of Reader's
 features could be accessed from within iGoogle. With Michael Bolin's
 Your
Page Here gadget, you can embed all of Reader (or any other page, for
that matter) as its own tab within your iGoogle page.

 For all you Facebook users, Mario Romero has created a Reader
 application that allows you to embed your shared items into Facebook
 profile. It's a bit finick-y (you have to type in your 20-digit Reader
 ID), but it shows how open platforms (Reader's and Facebook's) can be
 used together without needing permission from either party.

Fun Desserts

 We've posted
before about add-ons that others have made for Reader, but they've
generally been of a functional nature (like notifiers and browser
buttons). The Google Reader Theme that Jon Hicks made is entirely unlike
that in that it doesn't add any functionality, it just makes Reader look
very different (some might say Mac-like). A fresh face for Reader can be
a lot of fun, and we were happy to see just how seamless Jon managed to
make it.

 Finally, if Reader is just too serious for you and you'd like to view
 your feeds through a lolcat perspective, Ian McKellar's LOL Feeds may
 be the thing for you.  There's been a lot of discussion this weekend
 about the subscriber counts that have recently appeared in Reader's
 search results. Leaderboards have been drawn up, numbers are being
 compared and in some cases there's confusion as to how these numbers
 compare with other subscriber metrics. Additionally, we've made changes
 (some as recently as today) as to how counts are being calculated. This
 is probably going to be pretty boring unless you're a feed publisher,
 but we thought it would be best to explain things a bit. Here are the
 various numbers you may come across, and what they all mean:


Google subscriber counts: These numbers include subscribers across all
Google services, including Reader, iGoogle, and Orkut.  You can see them
in Reader's feed search results (pictured below) and the Google
Webmaster Tools. Additionally, our crawler reports them to the publisher
each time we fetch the feed. Reader's feed search was recently showing
stale and incomplete data, but as of today (October 15) the numbers
should be the same everywhere.



 FeedBurner numbers: If  you use FeedBurner to manage and track your
 feed, you will see a subscriber count there that is attributed to
 "Google Feedfetcher." This number is a sum of all the feeds that you
 have redirecting to your FeedBurner feed URL. So if
 http://www.example.com/atom.xml has 3 subscribers,
 http://www.example.com/rss.xml has 7 subscribers and
 http://feeds.feedburner.com/Example (where you redirect the other two
 feeds now) has 12 subscribers, then you will see 3 + 7 + 12 = 22
 subscribers reported in the FeedBurner interface.

 What this all means if you're a feed publisher is that if you're
 interested in getting the most comprehensive overview of your
 subscribers, you should be using a service like FeedBurner or Google
 Webmaster Tools. On the other hand, if you're a Reader user, we hope
 you take advantage of the numbers that we now show next to search
 results, so that you can pick the most appropriate feed to subscribe
 to.  It’s exactly three months to the day since I had my heart attack.
 What has followed has been a life-altering experience, forcing me to
 learn some hard lessons about life, myself and of course being a
 first-time entrepreneur.

 I have had to institute numerous behavioral changes over the past 90
 days. But what I found was that some of my worst and most deep-seated
 habits were among the easiest to overcome — smoking, for example, as
 well eating a meat-rich diet and avoiding exercise. It’s the little
 things that have proved to be a challenge.

 Simplification Through Elimination

 I was reading a review of the Macbook Air over on Macworld when I
 realized that the machine and post-recovery me have a lot in common. I
 have to be very careful as to how I use my mental and physical
 resources, for there is a high risk of relapse. Similarly, the Macbook
 Air comes with miniscule amount of storage space, so one needs to be
 careful about how to use it. The machine’s battery power limitations
 remind me of how much time I have to devote to work on a daily basis.

 It has been hard to use the Macbook Air as my primary computer, just as
 it’s been hard to change all those pesky “little things.” Indeed, the
 Macbook Air is an acquired taste. It’s also an apt reflection of an
 effective “simplification through elimination” strategy.

 Three months on, I am looking to eliminate a number of things from
 life: excessive public appearances, too much travel and many, many RSS
 feeds. I am going to cut down the effort I spend on certain projects
 and focus on making the most of what we have at hand. Stay tuned for
 more details.

 Empower To Power Up

 One of the upsides to my health setback was that I discovered the
 amazing abilities of my team. When faced with adversity, each one of
 them picked up whatever they felt comfortable with and ran with it.
 From editorial to sales to the company and everything in between — the
 team executed on our strategy. Batteries Om not included.

 I think one of the biggest problems I had as a first-time entrepreneur
 was an inability to let go; I was always second-guessing every decision
 not made by myself and was obsessed with minutiae. Three months on,
 having seen the Giga Gang at work, I realized what a mistake that was.
 You empower people, and in turn they power you to do good things. Now I
 am finding more time to focus on writing, reporting and spending time
 on projects like our upcoming conference, Structure 08.

 Anyway folks, thanks for reading — and please don’t forget to get your
 cardiac check-up. Many of us in Silicon Valley refuse to acknowledge
 that we live a high-stress existence and are prone to all sorts of
 problems that stem from an 18-hour-a-day, non-stop lifestyle. Cardiac
 disease is one of the deadliest silent killers of the modern age, and I
 urge you to learn from my mistakes. (More information on this @ the
 American Heart Association web site.) Please let me know if you want me
 to post information about symptoms of heart disease and other
 heart-related problems. And if you need help, I am just an email away.




 With the clock ticking on FCC Chairman Kevin Martin’s tenure, his
 special friends in the phone business are asking him to give them the
 moon, the stars and the sun: In other words, a cable TV version of
 number portability.

Verizon today asked the Federal Communications Commission to require the
cable industry to make it as easy for consumers to choose a new video
provider as it already is for them to switch voice providers. The
process to switch video providers is more cumbersome for consumers…Cable
incumbents do not accept disconnect orders from the new provider;
instead, they require the customer to contact them directly to cancel
service after choosing a new video provider and to return equipment.
(press release)

 Verizon’s arguments and press release may seem consumer-friendly, but
 one has to take all of it with a barrel of salt. Now, as you well know,
 I am no fan of cable companies — who apparently want to watch what you
 are doing inside your living room — but it’s hard to believe Verizon.

 Even despite all the legal and other hassles, the satellite guys have
 been competing with cable companies for video customers — and they
 didn’t need a sugar daddy (aka the FCC) to help them out. Verizon
 should learn to compete in the open market.

 Must I remind you that Verizon is the same company that rips out copper
 cables in favor of its own fiber, thereby taking away your ability to
 switch your broadband or voice service to another provider? Verizon
 itself delayed the switching of “broadband” service when customers
 wanted to buy DSL from another company, thus driving many of them out
 of business. In fact, incumbent phone companies indulge in such delays
 even now.

 I think both incumbents — the cable and phone operators — are waging a
 war of words, and none of them, including the newly “open” Verizon,
 have consumers’ best interests in mind.

 The P2P arguments, open networks, and now video portability all seem to
 be part of a calculated image makeover for Verizon. But as my
 granddaddy used to say: Just because you paint stripes on a donkey, it
 doesn’t make it a zebra.




 I was having breakfast this morning with Salil Deshpande from Bay
 Partners.  Salil and I were talking about assessing company progress
 and how best to measure that progress.  Salil invests in super
 early-stage deals and has his companies report to him on their progress
 on a frequent basis.  He said that he had one CEO who would report on
 his progress in such florid language that eventually Salil had to
 forbid his use of adjectives in his progress reports.  Salil said that
 he didn't want to hear that things were going great.  He wanted to hear
 precisely how things were going.

 I nearly jumped out of my seat.  Salil had articulated one of my
 biggest pet peeves when it comes to company pitches (and board meetings
 for that matter).  I hate adjectives.  I don't want to hear that one of
 the company founders is a "fantastic sales exec."  I want to hear that
 she was Presidents Club the last twelve years running.  I don't want to
 hear that the product is "revolutionary and paradigm-shifting."  I want
 to hear about the specific features of the product that are
 differentiated and how.  I don't want to hear that the company has
 "massive market traction."  I want to see a graph of progressive
 quarterly sales and a giant sales pipeline.

 Adjectives are not convincing.  Facts are convincing.  I may not agree
 with the conclusions a company draws from those facts.  But I will at
 least be in a position to appropriately assess those conclusions.
 Whereas adjectives are all about conclusions without the underlying
 facts.  As an entrepreneur, you are far better off having me determine
 that your market is "massive," your founders are "brilliant," and your
 product is "elegant," than to tell me that your company has "an elegant
 solution serving a massive market designed by brilliant founders."  So
 reread your pitch and remove all of the adjectives.  It will go
 massively, monumentally, gargantuanly. colossally better that way.

	    The Telegraph reports that 70 students from the Queen
	    Elizabeth School in Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, were joined by
	    over 100 other youths to celebrate an end of term party by
	    "having unprotected sex in a village square."

Alison Hughes, the deputy head of the Queen Elizabeth School in Kirkby
Lonsdale, Cumbria, was so concerned that she detailed the "catalogue of
disasters" in a two-page letter to parents, warning them about the
sexual activity, violent behaviour and alleged drug abuse that took
place.

 She wrote: "We have had to help a disturbingly high number of girls
 through the aftermath of having unprotected sex that evening, most of
 whom have told us they were too drunk to be in control of themselves.
 The risks are real. Assume the worst."

 Neil Taplin, the landlord of the nearby George and Dragon pub, said
 that youths had urinated against his wall and sworn at him when he
 refused to sell them cigarettes. "They were a law to themselves," he
 said. "It was upsetting for people in the village. We are all quite
 close and look out for each other."

 A resident involved in the clean-up said that she saw evidence of drug
 use, blood stains and broken glass and said that a newly fitted sink

Readers are submitting their best life hack for a chance to win an
autographed copy of our new book, Upgrade Your Life.  Here's our latest
winner.  Reader CK uses neat automation trick when there's heavy-duty
copy and pasting to be done: I have one very simple AutoHotkey script
which I use when I need to do some massive copying and pasting work,
which simplifies the task into just one keystroke: Win+C. With this
script, I run Notepad (or any program to paste the content into), browse
through some web sites, select text or pictures, and hit Win+C to
capture the contentmdashwithout leaving my browser.  The script switches
to the destination program (Notepad or otherwise), pastes the
information, and returns me to my browser automatically.  Check out the
video for how it works.  It's good for transferring bits of data between
two programs like compiling a list of email addresses. It's also
customizablemdashinstead of entering a new line, it can move on to the
next cell in the spreadsheet.

 For you AutoHotkey scripters, here's the source of CK's script:

#c:: Send, {CTRLDOWN}c{CTRLUP}{ALTDOWN}{TAB}{ALTUP} sleep, 300 Send,
{CTRLDOWN}v{CTRLUP}{ENTER}{ALTDOWN}{TAB}{ALTUP} return


To try our the compiled executable yourself, download it here.  To learn
more about writing your own Windows programs with AutoHotkey, see Adam's
feature on how to turn any action into a keyboard shortcut with
AutoHotkey.

 Congrats, CK!  You've just earned yourself an autographed copy of
 Upgrade Your Life.

 There's still time to win one of the last five books that are left;
 here's how.






 Social mapping service Loopt will soon be available on select Verizon
 Wireless phones.  Starting next month, certain Verizon wireless users
 will be able to find friends in a location-based manner, share
 information and status updates with each other.  Loopt also has
 geo-tagging photo options.  As the Loopt service supports AIM buddies,
 Verizon users with Loopt on their phones will be able to connect and
 share with their AOL friends as well.  While a number of social-mapping
 services have emerged in the past year or so, this particular
 partnership between Verizon and Loopt allows Verizon to provide
 additional social capabilities directly through its own wireless
 network, between Verizon users as well as Loopt friends.  As mobile
 devices enable more social interaction and wireless providers become
 more competitive in their social incentives for retaining customers
 (think top 5 friends to call free, across networks), incorporating such
 social features will attract a younger demographic for mobile use,
 which is typically the user base that utilizes such peripheral mobile
 phone services.  ShareThis






 BitTorrent tracker TorrentSpy is closing its doors.  After years of
 court battles against copyright holders and lots of money poured into
 its legal defense, TorrentSpy has decided to shut down its service,
 according to The Register.  That’s one point for the MPAA.  TorrentSpy
 lost a major court case to the MPAA last December, when TorrentSpy was
 found guilty of destroying evidence, making it impossible to hold a
 fair trial, and raked up a $30,000 fine.  The whole situation, which
 had dragged on for several months and even led TorrentSpy to block US
 IP addresses in an effort to avoid legal incrimination for providing
 the torrent-tracking service in the states, has aided in the
 anti-torrent movement gaining additional leverage in the larger war
 between copyright holders and torrents.  TorrentSpy founder Justin
 Bunnell, however, has stated that the loss of the court battle doesn’t
 have anything to do with the company’s decision to close down its
 service.  Bunnell posted the following statement on TorrentSpy:
     We have decided on our own, not due to any court order or
     agreement, to bring the Torrentspy.com search engine to an end and
     thus we permanently closed down worldwide on March 24, 2008.  The
     legal climate in the USA for copyright, privacy of search requests,
     and links to torrent files in search results is simply too hostile.
     We spent the last two years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars,
     defending the rights of our users and ourselves.  Ultimately the
     court demanded actions that in our view were inconsistent with our
     privacy policy, traditional court rules, and international law;
     therefore, we now feel compelled to provide the ultimate method of
     privacy protection for our users - permanent shutdown.

    It was a wild ride,
     The TorrentSpy Team
 As the US and our legal system has been the primary reason for
 TorrentSpy’s demise, The Register has gone on to point out that the
 blocking of US IP addresses unfortunately resulted in a loss of
 traction and advertising dollars for the TorrentSpy service.
 Additionally, TorrentSpy’s legal loss may in fact give even more reason
 for torrents to be targeted in other countries as well.  ShareThis





 Here at the Westin in Los Angeles, connectivity is pretty good — about
 a megabit in each direction. (For a fee, of course.) But the last two
 days, at the Hilton in Loma Linda and the University of Redlands, were
 terrible. I’m not sure if it was just because they blocked stuff (as
 was the case with Redlands), or because the system was bad (as was the
 case with the Hilton), but I’ve come to the conclusion that two things
 cause these kinds of problems in general. One is charging for something
 that ought to be free. The other is subtracting value from something
 that doesn’t need it and only pisses off users.  In the long run it
 makes as much sense for hotels to charge for Internet as it does to
 charge for television. (Yes, they used to do that too. There were
 coin-operated TVs.) Or for using the toilet. But it’s a business
 because they know they need Internet service now, and because doing it
 themselves is too complicated. So they hire these outside outfits to do
 it for them. (In the case of the Hilton it was iBahn.) And too many of
 them just don’t do a good job.  Yet we saw in Loma Linda how easy it is
 to bring fiber to homes, and for anybody to hook by fiber to anybody.
 The cabling and conduit are progressing upwards in convenience and
 downward in price, to a point where it will be as easy to put in fiber
 as it is to install a drip irrigation system. What makes the Interent
 complicated is that it comes to most places as a secondary service to
 telephony and television. Yet it doesn’t have to be, and in the long
 run it won’t be.

 Back last Fall, when news came that the Medill School of Journalism was
 thinking about changing its name (and in fact had already dropped “of
 Journalism” from its website index page), I wrote a post saying,
 basically, that this was wrong as well as dumb. In fact, I thought it
 was so wrong, and so lacking in support, that it would die on the vine.
 Well, apparently not. Eric Zorn reports in the Chicago Tribune that the
 idea is not only alive, but wrong as ever. Names “reportedly under
 consideration” (by a secretive committee) include “The Medill School of

 In The Future of News, Steve Boriss writes,



  More than most, I am sympathetic to scrapping the word “journalism,”
which has come to be associated with a failing model that only its
practitioners still believe delivers objective, verified truths. But do
we really want to combine news gathering with sales and entertainment
disciplines like marketing, media, and persuasion? And, isn’t the public
tired of journalism insisting it is providing pure “information,” and in
fact showing increased interest in a more helpful and stimulating
combination of fact and opinion?





  The right answer must be too simple for j-school eggheads — the
“Medill School of News.” By news, I mean “new information about a
subject of common interest that is shared within a community.”
Everything from as small as news of family and friends, which is now
being served by Facebook and MySpace, to as large as news of our
universe. Not just news of government, but also news of the private
sector, our neighborhoods, our vocations, and our avocations. The public
no longer believes in “journalism.” But renaming it “news” is a change
they can believe in.


 I almost like “School of News”. And I agree that it’s wacky to combine
 news (or journalism, or both) with “entertainment disciplines” (though
 I wouldn’t cal them that. I even agree that “the public no longer
 believes…” but I’m not sure it’s journalism that they doubt.  As it
 happens I’m sitting in the Annenberg School for Communication, where
 Media Re:public is about to begin. On the wall of the vast lobby are
 six big flat-screen TVs, four in the middle with news channels, one on
 the right with ESPN and one on the left with CNN. Sound comes from the
 last two. Nobody is watching. Yet at our table we can’t ignore the CNN
 one, which is blabbing behind our heads, which are turned away. For
 most of the last hour CNN has been obsessing on the murder of a Rutgers
 student in front of her toddler son. I’ve heard “stabbed multiple
 times” so many times that my inner Mona Shaw wants to take a hammer to
 the screen. I can’t find the story on the CNN.com index page, but maybe
 I’m not looking hard enough. In any case, I’m sure that what they’re
 pushing out the tube is news yet not journalism.  And I think I’d
 rather have Medill teach the latter. No matter what they call the
 place.

 There is a new version 07 of the Tabulator
out.   This is the generic data browser which lets you do useful things
with your RDF data the moment it's on the web.

It works by exploring the web of relationship between things, loading
more data from the web as you go.  Then, if you find a pattern of
information you are interested in, it will search for all occurrences of
that pattern and display them in tables, maps, calendars, and so on.


In the same session, you can explore, say, some geocoded photos taken
from on a  trip with a GPS,

and then separately explore where in the world the tabulator developers
are based.


Then, you can project both datasets onto the same map.


Or onto the same calendar, for data with a time component.  This shows
the cross-domain power of the semantic web.


This means you can correlate data from completely different domains.
Think of all the different mash-ups people have made for putting things
like friends houses, photos, or coffee shops on the web.  Each a
different mash-up for a different data source.


For data in RDF (or any XML with a GRDDL profile), though, then you
don't have to program anything.  You can just explore it and map it. And
you can map many different data sources at the same time.

Oh, and for developers, the core of the tabulator is an open source RDF
library with a complete tested RDF/XML parser, a store which smushes on
owl:sameAs and owl:[Inverse]FunctionalProperty, and web crawling query
engine supporting basic SPARQL. Enjoy.


	Just prior to jetting off to Austin last week, I started playing
	around with a mobile version of this site. While a personal blog
	is hardly a site that really needs one (unlike, say, an app with
	a proven mobile user-base like Twitter), I wanted to see what
	would be involved in re-factoring this design into something
	more fitting for a mobile environment.






 The first step was to create a mobile style sheet. For this I
 duplicated the CSS file I've already built for large screens, and
 started stripping out the style that doesn't work so well on a smaller
 screen. The layout was simplified into a more linear single column, and
 some elements were re-done to provide a larger target area for a
 maximum Fitts factor, and background images were dropped wherever
 possible to cut down on bandwidth demands. I tried building something
 that would work well on more mobile devices than just the iPhone, but
 given that it's my testing device, it works best on that platform for
 now.

 And while I was at it, I thought hey, why not do a TV style sheet too?
 I've got a Wii, it's got a great browser, and a low-res TV screen could
 benefit from the same kind of special attention given a mobile device.
 So I built one of those as well, doing things like increasing font
 size, increasing border widths, and stretching images to double their
 original size.

 But here's the thing about media-specific style sheets: the browser in
 question has to support them. Mobile Safari grabs all screen media
 style sheets, and ignores the handheld media type entirely. So despite
 good intentions, my efforts were wasted on it. And that's what led me
 down the road of user agent sniffing...

 Okay, let's get this out of the way up front: user agent sniffing
 sucks. Devices like the Wii and the iPhone have incredibly capable
 browsers that can render these sites the same as any desktop browser,
 so it's reasonable to assume users will want to do so from time to
 time. (And I suspect that's why Mobile Safari uses screen in the first
 place.) Forcing a specific version sucks... if done improperly. But
 when used well, and not mandatory for the user, I think it's not
 entirely evil. And it leads to other potential improvements beyond what
 CSS can provide, like selective content serving.

 The way to sensibly handle sniffing seemed to lie in providing an out:
 the mobile and TV versions of the site both have a special header on
 every page that provides a "regular site" toggle link. Any time someone
 wants to switch back to the regular site, the link is right there in
 front of them. And all versions now have toggle links in the footer to
 switch between different media types; given that I've seen this on
 multiple mobile sites, it feels like the site's footer is resolving
 into a standard place for where these type of switches ultimately
 belong.

 To make all this work, I had to bust out the PHP. I'll preface this by
 saying I'm hardly a proficient coder, so there are bound to be ways to
 optimize what I'm showing below. I started with a pair of arrays: a
 list of mobile browser user agent strings, and a second list of TV
 browsers. The latter is a bit light at the moment, due to my lack of
 knowledge of what sort of browsers are available for use on TVs. (And
 that underscores why having a media toggle is useful: if the browser in
 question isn't flagged by the sniff, the user can manually invoke the
 TV version.)


// ========================== // media check

// array of mobile devices $userAgentsMobile = array (
  "Blackberry", "Blazer", "Handspring", "iPhone", "iPod", "Kyocera",
  "LG", "Motorola", "Nokia", "Palm", "PlayStation Portable", "Samsung",
  "Smartphone", "SonyEricsson", "Symbian", "WAP", "Windows CE",
);

// array of tv devices $userAgentsTv = array (
  "Nintendo Wii", "Playstation 3", "WebTV"
);

 Arrays in place, the next step was building a few functions to do
 things like comparing these arrays with the user's actual user agent
 string, and setting cookies to make these media types persist. More on
 the latter in a second.

// this function takes two arguments: an array of user // agents, and a
specific user agent.  // it will then try to see if the specific user
agent exists // within the array. If so, it will return true, otherwise
// it returns false.  function checkMediaType($uaList, $uaKnown) {
	// check user agent string against array // return true if
	found, or false if not found if(in_array($uaKnown, $uaList)) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
} // this function takes one argument: a string value that // specifies
a media profile. It will then set a cookie in // the user's browser. It
returns the media profile value, // to be used as a variable later in
the page function selectMedia($media) {
  setcookie ('media', $media, time()+31536000, '/'); return $media;
}

 With those functions in place, the code below ended up being the core
 of my script. In the first major if statement, I'm checking to see
 whether a cookie is set; the cookie exists to avoid parsing the user
 agent arrays every single time the site is loaded. I doubt I'm saving
 that much time if any, given my currently very simple arrays. But I can
 see them growing over time, so it seems to make sense that this value
 should persist on the user's end once the user agent has been
 determined.

 But if no cookie is found, then I'm doing the actual sniffing. I check
 the user agent string against both the mobile and TV arrays, and then
 act on them if they match one or the other. If neither matches, I
 default to the screen version of the site.

// show standard screen version by default $mediaVersion = "screen";

// toggle media version if cookie is set if (isset($_COOKIE["media"])) {
  if ($_COOKIE["media"] == "mobile") {
    $mediaVersion = selectMedia("mobile");
  } elseif ($_COOKIE["media"] == "tv") {
    $mediaVersion = selectMedia("tv");
  } elseif ($_COOKIE["media"] == "screen") {
    $mediaVersion = selectMedia("screen");
  }
} else {
  // if no cookie found, sniff media type then set cookie
  $knownUserAgent = false;

  // compare the device arrays against the // client's user agent
  $mediaTypeMobile =
    checkMediaType($userAgentsMobile, $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
  $mediaTypeTV =
    checkMediaType($userAgentsTv, $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);

  // if media version is found, set a media type cookie // otherwise
  flag this browser as screen to save // time on future loads if
  ($mediaTypeMobile) {
    $mediaVersion = selectMedia("mobile");
  } elseif ($mediaTypeTV) {
    $mediaVersion = selectMedia("tv");
  } else {
    $mediaVersion = selectMedia("screen");
  }
}

 And then the last step is checking to see whether any of the media
 toggle links have been selected. If a user is viewing the mobile site
 and wants to switch over to the regular site, I need to re-set the
 cookie so their new preference persists. This is all done through
 simple query strings; the HTTP GET variable being checked for (media)
 can be invoked simply by adding ?media=mobile to the end of a URL or
 link.

// override media version and set a new cookie // if they have selected
a "show {media} site" link if ($_GET["media"]) {
  if ($_GET["media"] == "mobile") {
    $mediaVersion = selectMedia("mobile");
  } elseif ($_GET["media"] == "tv") {
    $mediaVersion = selectMedia("tv");
  } elseif ($_GET["media"] == "screen") {
    $mediaVersion = selectMedia("screen");
  }
}

 Now that the cookie exists and the $mediaVersion variable has a value,
 I'm all set. Anywhere in the rest of my site, I can use a simple if
 statement to filter out the specific media version I'm targetting, and
 selectively show or hide content for it. This is how I'm hiding my
 header photo from the mobile version, for example (simplified for
 clarity):

<?php
  // don't serve this up if we're talking mobile if ($mediaVersion ==
  "screen" || $mediaVersion == "tv")  {
?>
  <div id="header-photo"> <img src="/i/photos/<?php
    echo $currentPhoto["largephoto"]?>" width="505" height="243"
    alt="<?php echo $currentPhoto["description"]?>" />
  </div>
<?php
  }
?>

 I put together the entire set of functions and a couple of small
 demonstrations of selective content into a file you can grab. (live
 demo)

 And to finish, a couple of highlights from the alternate media versions
 of this site. The mobile version goes small by stripping out images
 where appropriate to save on download times; the header photo is gone,
 avatars on comment pages are gone, and most of the decorative PNGs have
 been removed or converted to CSS border properties. While the TV
 version goes big by doubling font size, increasing border widths,
 stretching the header image to fill the entire horizontal screen width,
 doubles avatar sizes, and using a higher-resolution version of the
 site's logo.

 Quick caveat: I've only had the opportunity to test the alternate media
 styles on a limited range of devices, and likely won't any time soon.
 Device testing is too hard if you don't already have access to a wide
 range of devices. I tried stripping out some of the more complex CSS
 tricks like overflow clearing and absolute positioning, so even my Treo
 doesn't make a horrible mess out of the site, but no guarantees.

 And the bonus question: why am I serving up the media versions with
 media profiles set to all? Simple reason: clicking through and viewing
 the TV-only version on a computer was seriously ugly, because it
 ignored the style sheet. As it should. But people will click through
 anyway, so that was problematic. Simple fix: media="all"

 Last weekend, I went for a drive with my wife up the Hudson River.
 Well, she was driving.  I was playing with the new Dash Express GPS
 navigation system.  The Dash is not perfect, but it holds a lot of
 promise.  (See CrunchGear’s review).  It was able to pinpoint a
 hard-to-find home on a country road.  And it let me toggle between a
 2-D and 3-D view, bleating out in a computerized female voice when the
 next turn was coming up.  I had to mute that because the voice was
 driving my wife crazy.  In fact, she found the whole screen pretty
 distracting, so I had to turn it away from her.  But my three-year-old
 son in the back seat couldn’t get enough of it.  He kept yelling at me
 to move my hand whenever I was blocking his view of the blue car on the
 screen that somehow went exactly wherever we did.  Although, he did
 point out that our real car is green.  (Can’t those Dash folks get
 anything right?) The Dash is a GPS unit that can communicate back to
 the Internet using cellular data networks or WiFi (it contains three
 chips: GPS,WiFi, and GPRS).  You can’t browse the Web, but you can use
 the touch screen to search Yahoo Local for nearby gas stations,
 restaurants, airports, and any other place that might be listed.  One
 of my favorite features: it can tell you the price of gas at each
 station nearby so you can price shop without wasting gas driving
 around.  The Dash even found a chocolate shop for us when the one that
 had been recommended to us was closed.  Once you find a place you want
 to go to, you just hit “route” and it gets you there.  It picks what it
 thinks are the two or three most direct routes. And it even shows you
 the traffic on those routes based on historical patterns, sensors, and,
 if available, traffic data from other Dash drivers.  You also can
 program the Dash from the Web and create GPS mashups.  For instance,
 you can mark your own addresses on a map, find places on Yahoo local,
 or tap into any GeoRSS feed (or make your own) and send it to the GPS
 unit in your car.  I’d love to be able to access the Web with a browser
 as well, or at least get regular RSS feeds, but the temptation to check
 those things while driving might be too great (which is why that is not
 a feature).  The best thing about the Dash is that it connects you to
 other Dash drivers to give you traffic intelligence.   Because each
 Dash unit is sending back data about its speed and location, once a
 critical mass of a few hundred or a thousand drivers get a Dash in the
 city where you live, you will arguably have the best live traffic
 information available.  At last that is the theory.  Early adopters
 will have to wait for that critical mass to build up before they can
 test it out.  One request:  For people living in big cities with street
 parking, knowing when a nearby Dash driver just vacated a spot would be
 a killer feature for future versions of the software.  Okay, I actually
 have some more requests.  An opt-in messaging system with other Dash
 drivers would be awesome.  If handled correctly, could be very helpful
 and create a strong sense of community among Dash drivers.  (No plans
 for that either, but I think it is a good idea).  Here is where the
 Dash needs some help.  If it picks the correct route, you are fine.
 But if you know a better one, you cannot tell it which way you want to
 go.  You can only pick a destination and hope that it doesn’t lead you
 astray.  I noticed that it tends to favor major highways, even if they
 are 20 miles out of your way.  All you can do is keep driving, and
 eventually it will pick a new route based on your GPS coordinates.
 Something as simple as being able to move the line of the suggested
 route with your finger, like you can on Google Maps with a cursor,
 would fix that problem.  Another gripe: you cannot do multi-point
 routing from the GPS unit itself.  You must enter a new destination
 each time you get into the car.  (Although, you can create a map of
 destinations on the Web and send them to your unit as saved
 destinations).  A final major flaw with the digital map in the Dash is
 that as you are driving along a strange highway, it doesn’t show you
 what cities you are passing.  That is how I mentally keep track of
 where I am when I am driving long distances.  On that ride along the
 Hudson, I found myself repeatedly referring to our old, beat-up, road
 atlas to get my bearings. The thing that kills me is that the Dash knew
 exactly what cities we were passing, it just wouldn’t show me.  These
 are all minor quibbles.  I am particularly excited about the the fact
 that the device’s capabilities will grow over time, especially the
 ability to see live traffic information and to download customized
 lists of destinations and geographically-relevant feeds.  The Dash goes
 on sale starting now at Amazon for $399, plus a monthly fee of $10 (the
 first three months are free).

 Google Israel is sporting an all black theme today, in support of Earth
 Hour’s efforts to raise awareness around energy conservation. From the
 page telling confused Israeli’s what’s going on: Google users in Israel
 will notice today that we “turned the lights out” on the Google.co.il
 homepage as a gesture to raise awareness of a worldwide energy
 conservation effort called Earth Hour.  On Thursday, March 27, 2008,
 Earth Hour invites people in Israel to turn off their lights for one
 hour – from 8:00pm to 9:00pm.  Given our company’s commitment to
 environmental awareness and energy efficiency, we strongly support the
 Earth Hour campaign, and have darkened our homepage today to help
 spread awareness of what we hope will be a highly successful global
 event.  Google has a long history of caring about all things green.  Of
 course, this begs the question as to whether or not Google should
 change their site permanently to black to save display power (see
 blackle). Google looked into it, and said the opposite is true:
 “displaying black may actually increase energy usage.” I won’t even
 bring up the irony that Google, according to the study they cited, is
 actually increasing energy usage in Israel by having a black home page.
 The point is, people, they care.  Update: Earth Hour in San Francsico
 (and everywhere else except Israel) is March 29 at 8 pm. It’s important
 that everyone turn off their lights then. We’ll need that extra power
 if Google goes black here in the U.S., too.  Crunch Network:

 Chris Pirillo has announced a new, large scale open source CMS project
 that aims to “de-geekify” website tools (announcement video above).
 The project will be built on the open source Drupal framework: “For the
 geeks: Drupal has so much power in its core, and enough fantastic
 community-contributed modules, that I think it’s time to assemble an
 Install Profile, complete with beautiful (accessible, microformat’ed,
 high quality) themes, pre-set Views for any Web community to either
 install on their own or have hosted at any given Web host that supports
 Drupal with optimizations. The benefits to you should be more than
 obvious….And I don’t mean just the framework for the community
 platform, I mean… like, it’s ready to go. “It’s not the features, it’s
 the implementation.” I chatted with Pirillo after the announcement.
 What he’s looking to achieve is delivering a multi-faceted, open
 source, easy to use end CMS. To break that down further: imagine
 installing a package on your web host that immediately delivered Digg
 style functionality, or photo sharing, a community forum, a blog, a
 social network ala Facebook, or even a clone of the growing number of
 FriendFeed style sites, or a combination of all or any of them. Here’s
 the important difference to existing solutions: imagine that you
 wouldn’t have to touch a piece of code to activate the various aspects.
 Imagine that a color change made in one module automatically applies
 across all module or as specified, without the need (again) to touch
 code.  The project would also be committed to best practice in
 DataPortability with OpenID, OAuth and even support for OpenSocial: The
 bottom line is freedom and flexibility - the freedom to choose, the
 freedom to grow, the freedom to leave (and take your profile data with
 you, or easily transfer it to another system). The flexibility to add
 features that pivot around the user or groups of users - whatever new
 tool may come along.  Pirillo is committed to building the community
 and project completely open source and without undue influence or
 commercial constraint, although he is willing to talk to potential
 partners.  Adam Kalsey has been assembling the project and Pirillo is
 looking for those interested to explore the idea some more and even
 come on board. A first release of an activity stream for Drupal is
 available here. It’s a noble idea with a perhaps insanely wide scope,
 but as Chris idealistically said to me tonight: “The deliverables must
 be realistic, but if you’re going to dream - dream big, and make sure
 the world benefits.” See our coverage of Crowd Fusion, another upcoming
 CMS system, being built by former Weblogs, Inc. cofounder Brian Alvey.

 In honor of Linux week at CrunchGear we sat down with Charles Ogilvie,
 Director of In-Flight Entertainment, to talk about how this start-up
 airline made Tux fly.  CG: Why did you pick linux for RED?  CO: Linux
 is very stable and agile. We were able to pare down the embedded
 seat-back side to only the libraries we need, license a container app
 and then write the code needed to tie everything together Which
 distribution are you using?
Flavors of Red Hat & Fedora (we have embedded seat-back units, seat &
distribution boxes and a head-end that consists of some file servers)
 How long was it in testing?
We’ve been developing it for 4 years and it has gone through numerous
iterations. Before a new version is released, it is tested on a
simulation rack
 Did Microsoft approach you about running Windows on the back end?
We’ve talked with a lot of software vendors.
 What was the hardest part about creating the system? Was it the
 software? The hardware?
The hardest part is maintaining agility. The beauty of the architecture
is that we can continue to move forward, innovate and constantly look
for additional areas to add new, unprecedented functionality like our
inflight food ordering system or seat-to-seat chat.
 Why don’t more people use Linux in high traffic situations like this?
I don’t know. They should.
 How often does it crash? The Linux machines, not the planes…
Resets or reboots occur in different areas. Because we are trying
different open source games, we do notice issues with porting them for
example. Over time, we work through those issues. Our inflight team
members (flight attendants) have the ability to reboot seats. The seat
units also monitor themselves and can reset themselves if they freeze or
lose connectivity (a heart-beat) with the head-end.
 What’s the deal with the in-flight chat? Why was that included? Have
 people connected through that?
Seat-to-seat chat and TV-Chat are some of the most fun features we have.
We’ve had everything from people striking up great conversations with
other guests in chats to groups using it laugh and have fun while
watching the same program. The whole idea behind it is to allow a sense
of community to take place in a typically confined, airborne
environment. I cannot wait for broadband and the chance for our
passengers to chat with the ground
 What’s in store for the future besides in-flight Wi-Fi?
The ability to compose a music-video playlist is pretty cool and on the
horizon. The READ section is also awesome in that it takes what is
typically a bunch of wasted trees (excess newspapers, periodicals) and
allows us to be more environmentally friendly and timely with things
like news/event info/sports/entertainment etc.
 Crunch Network:  CrunchBoard because it’s time for you to find a new
 Job2.0




 This morning, the New York Post ran a story with this headline: M’SOFT
 NOT YET ON BOARD
NO NAMES LINED UP YET FOR YAHOO!
 The article goes on to suggest that nobody in Silicon Valley wants to
 be on Microsoft’s alternate board for Yahoo for fear of “alienating
 both Yahoo! insiders and others who are aligned with the search giant.”
 This was news to us since we started gathering names of people who
 might be on that alternate board two weeks ago.  The sad truth is that
 nobody is afraid of Jerry Yang or any other Yahoo insiders (what’s left
 of them).  While the Post may have uncovered some individuals who may
 have been considered for the alternate board and declined, that is not
 the same as evidence “that the software giant actually doesn’t have
 anyone lined up.”  Because, in fact, Microsoft does have an alternate
 board lined up and the people chosen for it have agreed to serve if
 called upon to do so.  We have confirmed this with a member of the
 alternate board.  So why hasn’t Microsoft released its proposed slate?
 It is not because it cannot find anyone to serve on it.  More likely,
 the reason that Microsoft has gone dark is because it is deep in
 negotiations with Yahoo to close the deal.   The expectation for a
 revised bid of $34 a share or more is well-founded.  If a deal is
 imminent, there is no point in doing something hostile like propose a
 new slate of directors.  The absence of a slate actually means the
 chances of the deal going through are high. If Microsoft does decide to
 reveal the slate in the next few days, then you’ll know the
 negotiations aren’t going well.  Crunch Network:  CrunchGear drool over

  The Art & Science of CSS is not a very thick book, and it doesn't have
  to be since it is not a reference book on CSS. It is a rather quick
  read, but it contains useful and practical tips on how to create
  certain design elements with CSS. These are tips that you can adapt
  and use in your own projects.

 Five authors have contributed to this book: Cameron Adams, Jina Bolton,
 David Johnson, Steve Smith, and Jonathan Snook. Bolton, Johnson, and
 Snook have written one chapter each, while Steve Smith and Cameron
 Adams have both written two chapters. It's an author line-up that
 raises expectations.

 There's not a lot to say about the general structure of the book. There
 is no introduction to CSS or HTML in here. Instead you jump right in
 and get working on the examples. During the course of the seven
 chapters you will find new or different ways of styling, creating, or
 manipulating headings, images, backgrounds, navigation, forms, rounded
 corners, and tables. Those are the main topics of each chapter, but in
 each chapter you will pick up other tips as well.

 So, what do I think of this book after reading it? Well, it's not bad.
 Plenty of good tips and useful techniques are described in it. It's not
 perfect either. I guess it's partly down to personal preference, but I
 am not too fond of books that have multiple authors unless there is one
 main editor that makes sure all chapters are at least reasonably
 similar in style. I can't quite put it into words, but to some extent
 the different styles distract me from the actual content.

 Apart from the difference in writing style between the authors, there
 is also the difference in coding practices for both CSS and HTML. It's
 ok for someone who is experienced and can see that the differences are
 often just personal preferences, but this book is meant for people who
 aren't CSS or HTML experts. I can easily imagine how confusing it is to
 see different approaches to font sizing in different chapters of the
 same book, with no explanation of why. I think consistency would have
 been good here.

 With that in mind, reading The Art & Science of CSS will teach you how
 to use CSS to accomplish a number of useful design tasks, so I think
 it's worth its price unless you already know most of what there is to
 know about CSS.

 As with all SitePoint books, there are sample chapters you can download
 to find out if the book is right for you.

Saul Griffith has published a version of his talk at ETech as a website,
wattzon.org.

Saul's key points:  Solving global warming is an engineering problem. We
know the connection between greenhouse gases and global warming, and can
determine just how much carbon we're allowed to put into the atmosphere
to give us the temperature we can live with.  The answer isn't pretty.
He looks at it from both a personal point of view (how do I need to
change my lifestyle to use only my fair share of the global carbon
allowance) and from a global policy point of view (what are the
available sources of clean energy, how big are they, and what is the
scale of the industrialization effort required to harness them?)

From Wattzon:



The average American uses 11400 Watts of power continuously. This is the
equivalent of burning 114 x100 Watt light bulbs, all the time. The
average person globally uses 2255 Watts of power, or a little less than
23 x100 Watt light bulbs.

What are the consequences of us all using this much power?

What is the implied challenge of global warming in terms of how we
produce power?

What are the things we do as individuals in terms of using power that we
might change?

Wattzon.org hosts a document that gives us a framework for thinking
about these challenges, and how we might change our behaviours as
individuals as well as our collective behaviour as societies and global
citizens, if we are to meet the great challenge of the 21st century -
how to live in a world where we increasingly understand the resources to
be finite, and the consequences of our actions complex & inter-twined.

What temperature do we set climate change at? What CO2 concentration
does this imply we need to aim at? How much power can we get from fossil
fuels while still meeting this goal? How much power do we need to
install and produce from non-carbon technologies? What does this mean
for countries, corporations, and individuals?

Click a lightbulb to continue.

interview done by TechwebTV.)





 Great news: On April 23 and 24, Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco will host
 Web2Open, an unconference that anyone can participate in.

 To promote connections among attendees and complement the Expo
 sessions, this year's Open emphasizes discussion sessions over
 presentations. That means your participation is really key, whether you
 share your successes, your challenges or your questions.

 In addition to the traditional open-grid sign-ups where attendees fill
 in the sessions you want to discuss, we're also pre-scheduling a
 handful of roundtables and seeding them with people who are passionate
 about the topics. These sessions include Social Responsibility for Web
 2.0 Companies; Small Business Hacks; Troll Whispering; UI for Emerging
 Technologies; and iPhone Development. But wait, there's more! We're
 also organizing three Expo/Open hybrid sessions: presentations in the
 main conference that will be open to all Web2Open attendees, followed
 by discussions in the Open. Stay tuned for more info on those.

 You need a badge to attend the Open, but you can register gratis using
 the the code websf08opw (this free badge will admit you to the Web2Open
 sessions, Expo Keynotes, Show Floor and Launch Pad). Thanks to TechWeb
 (formerly CMP) and O'Reilly for making this possible.

 Btw, Tony Stubblebine and I are co-organizers. See you there!





 I can't draw. Really. I'm a competent interaction designer, but my
 graphic design skills are those of a plankton. I can't draw on the
 right side or the left side of my brain.

 Yet, like everyone else in business and technology, I need to
 communicate. As so many studies -- and common sense -- show, we make
 decisions better (or, at least, faster) when there are pictures
 involved. I've written awkward stick figures and embarrassingly
 asymmetric circles on whiteboards and the backs of napkins and
 envelopes to make points. And now there's a book to support those of us
 who have to communicate visually but shouldn't be allowed to. Dan
 Roam's The Back of the Napkin (Portfolio) is breezy in presentation but
 rigorous in approach. Essentially, it's a framework for understanding
 why presenting problems in visual form makes it easier to solve them
 and presenting ideas in visual form makes it easier to develop them and
 convince others that they're good ideas. Most important, it shows you
 how to show things, walking through some vivid examples and well-worn
 metaphors. Chances are you won't pick the same visual metaphors -- but
 you will think in terms of visual metaphors and that's what will stick.

 I hope I've made the case for this book, although I realize I would
 have done it more effectively if I had drawn something.




 Filed under: Audio, Internet Here at Download Squad HQ, we're (sadly)
 all-too-often reminded of the archaic buffoonery found in the world of
 big-business digital music and video. Whether it's the notion that DRM
 prevents piracy (hint: it doesn't) or the fact that by being
 blood-relatives of mafia bigshots label executives you are likely to
 escape a kneecapping lawsuit, the music industry has never been short
 of controversy as it struggles with piracy.  Since the dawn of Napster,
 the music industry has been crying, nay screaming, out for a digital
 music czar. Someone who 'gets' the digital arena. Someone who's been
 around the block, and never missed a beat (if you'll excuse the
 terrible pun) when it comes to the digital domain. So of course when
 Warner Music yelled from the rooftop 'We've got a Digital Music
 Guru!!', we believed that all equilibrium in the world had been
 restored. And then we read about this digital guru's next big plan, and
 our jubilation promptly turned sour.   Continue reading Warner Music's

 It's not exactly news that more and more chunks of our lives are lived
 on the Internet. But every now and then we get a reminder - of how, for
 example, the 'net increasingly is taking over jobs that used to be
 exclusively television's. Case in point: March Madness, a US sports
 phenomenon that is also a television phenomenon, disrupting regular
 programming for weeks every spring. It is now huge on the Web as well -
 and destined to get even more so this year.

 Because it eats up a good deal of April, too, we still have several
 more weeks of March Madness, the NCAA Men's Division annual basketball
 championship, a tourney with scores of games and a dizzyingly complex
 playoff structure. That gives us all plenty of time to check out this
 year's biggest deal, an experiment at Joost, the free video site. Joost
 is conducting a hugely ambitious live test of its video streaming
 system, planning to broadcast every single game to anyone anywhere in
 the world.

 The actual games are the least of March Madness, but the side
 activities are a Web phenomenon too.  There are dozens - probably
 hundreds - of sites and blogs keeping track of brackets, many collected
 at the Bracket Project. What's a bracket? As the usually invaluable
 Wikipedia explains, a bracket is the "diagrammatic representation of
 the series of games played during a tournament, named as such because
 it appears to be a large number of interconnected (punctuational)
 brackets." Got that? A 2006 New York Times article also attempted
 clarification, with equally opaque results. To me, anyway. See the pic
 above, which is sort of a help.

 Brackets aside, there's another March basketball Madness going on too,
 although you wouldn't know it from the buzz.  That would be the NCAA
 Women's Division Championship.  The women's games will be on TV - but
 on the cable sports network ESPN, which is pay TV, not the much bigger
 broadcast network CBS, home to the hottest guy games, which is free TV.
 (Actually, mostly the women's games will not be on ESPN either, but on
 ESPN2, the junior channel where the lesser sports get exiled.) But will
 Joost be broadcasting the women's games to the entire planet? Hah. What
 about the Bracket Project? Nada - although you can find brackets for
 the women's games at the bottom of this Wikipedia article on the 2008
 women's championship, and also on the CBS site.

 March Madness is so pervasive that even Republican Presidential
 candidate John McCain features a bracket (for the men's championship
 only) on his site. So you might expect that, since her strength is with
 women voters, Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's site
 is taking note of the women's basketball championship.  It does not
 appear so.  The Clinton campaign does have an event called March
 Madness. It's a voter registration drive. There's a moral there
 somewhere.

 Saul Bass is the master of film title design. Here’s his opening title
 sequence for “The Man With The Golden Arm.”




	 The backstory:




	 When the reels of film for Otto Preminger’s controversial new
	 drugs movie, The Man with the Golden Arm, arrived at US movie
	 theatres in 1955, a note was stuck on the cans –
	 “Projectionists – pull curtain before titles”.


	 Until then, the lists of cast and crew members which passed for
	 movie titles were so dull that projectionists only pulled back
	 the curtains to reveal the screen once they’d finished. But
	 Preminger wanted his audience to see The Man with the Golden
	 Arm’s titles as an integral part of the film.


	 The movie’s theme was the struggle of its hero – a jazz
	 musician played by Frank Sinatra – to overcome his heroin
	 addiction. Designed by the graphic designer Saul Bass the
	 titles featured an animated black paper-cut-out of a heroin
	 addict’s arm. Knowing that the arm was a powerful image of
	 addiction, Bass had chosen it – rather than Frank Sinatra’s
	 famous face – as the symbol of both the movie’s titles and its
	 promotional poster.


	 That cut-out arm caused a sensation and Saul Bass reinvented
	 the movie title as an art form. By the end of his life, he had
	 created over 50 title sequences for Preminger, Alfred
	 Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, John Frankenheimer and Martin
	 Scorsese.





“Anatomy of a Murder” title sequence.

	 Saul Bass: A Film Title Pioneer offers Bass’ thought process
	 behind his titles:




	 Saul Bass: “My initial thoughts about what a title can do was
	 to set mood and the prime underlying core of the film’s story,
	 to express the story in some metaphorical way. I saw the title
	 as a way of conditioning the audience, so that when the film
	 actually began, viewers would already have an emotional
	 resonance with it”


	 As Bass went forward, he proceeded in perfecting these
	 thoughts, creating mini-narratives which would help bring the
	 viewer into the film.


	 Writer Ken Coupland feels that in this respect, Bass is
	 something of a magician: “I believe that a great title sequence
	 almost literally hypnotizes you, especially the work of Saul
	 Bass where there’s a very strong repetitive swirling motion and
	 abstract things that happen that’s putting you into a
	 dream-like state.”




	 More of Bass’ title sequences after the jump.
Bass’ “Around the World in 80 Days” title sequence.


	 Notcoming.com has an interactive image gallery of titles
	 designed by Bass. His various techniques are discussed in the
	 site’s introduction.




	 Bass’ techniques are various and decidedly inconsistent: cutout
	 animation, montage, live action, and type design to name only
	 his more prominent exercises. Secondly, Bass exhibits an
	 exemplary use of color and movement. Often sequences begin with
	 a solid, empty frame of color (as with Exodus’ blue or North by
	 Northwest’s green). His design tactic in this context, although
	 characteristic, possesses subtly and variety.





“Psycho” titles.

	 Martin Scorcese on Bass:




	 His titles are not simply imaginative identification tags. When
	 his work comes on the screen, the movie itself truly begins.





“Walk on the Wild Side” titles.


“It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World” titles.


“Bunny Lake is Missing” titles.


“The Human Factor” titles.


“North by Northwest” titles.


“Vertigo” titles.

 What a fun day. IBM invited me over to its research building, where we
 moved atoms around with a tunneling electron microscope (among other
 things).  I shot some videos with my Qik cameras while Rocky was
 setting up his HD camcorders. The quality is low, but that’s because
 they didn’t have a 3G network up there so I needed to turn down my cell
 phone to a lower quality setting. Qik rocks because it pushes the
 videos to YouTube now.  Here’s the videos: A look at a machine that
 lays materials down at the atomic level. They are using this machine to
 try to find a new way to store information that will be 100 more dense
 (or maybe even more) than what’s possible with CMOS. At three minutes
 in you meet the guy who runs the lab. The engineer says that this
 machine can “airbrush with atoms.” I got several videos inside the
 office where they are using the scanning tunneling electron microscope.
 You know it’s a cool lab when there’s a barrel of liquid nitrogen
 underneath the desk. Part I (why keep it cold). Part II (why keep it
 silent). Part III (a drawing done with individual atoms).  A look at
 the world’s first hard drive (which was invented in the lab, so was the
 relational database, among other things we all take for granted now).
 Starting Wednesday we’ll have a daily show up on FastCompany.tv. This
 series will be up in a few weeks after we edit it and all that. I just
 wanted to give you a taste of what we saw today with our Qik cameras.
 Thanks so much to the researchers who spent time with us: •
 Shivakumar (Shiv) Vaithyanathan, PhD, Manager, Unstructured Information
 Mining
•       Mark Dean, PhD, IBM Fellow, Vice President, Almaden Research
Center •       Chris Lutz, PhD, Low-temperature Scanning Tunneling
Microscopy and Atom Manipulation scientist •       Markus Ternes, PhD,
postdoctoral scientist •       Sebastian Lutz, PhD, postdoctoral
scientist
 It’s amazing that science has progressed to the point where an idiot
 like me can pick up an iron atom and move it around to some place else
 with a click of a mouse.  Why does this science matter to all of us?
 Well, today’s hard drives need hundreds of thousands of atoms to store
 data. Think what they could do if they could get it down to a few
 atoms? Or, maybe, even one? They are doing research to find out if
 that’s possible, and, even if it is, what patterns of atoms work best?
 Oh, and you know how electronics work? By doing things with electrons.
 The thing is, almost all of our electronics work by doing something
 with the charge of the electrons.  Today IBM showed me that they are
 able to study something else: the spin of the electrons. They are
 excited by being able to do that because it will let them get even more
 information density than they thought was possible previously.  Thanks
 to Seagate, my sponsor, for making it possible for me to go around the
 world and do stuff like this. I have a feeling a few of their
 researchers are gonna watch these videos. ;-) You can read a lot more
 about what we saw today on Google.

  Andrew Mobbs, managing director of the Hatchery, has a big dream. He
  wants to move the world off of credit cards and onto using their cell
  phones to pay for things. He’s not the first to have that dream, but I
  think he’s thought through some of the problems better than other
  people I’ve talked to about this so far. He is in Silicon Valley
  today, visiting from London, UK, which is where he’s located.
 But that’s not what was interesting about my breakfast with him this
 morning. What I found really interesting was his dilemma as an
 entrepreneur. What is it?  1. His product is too difficult to use, so
 it needs some more work. That takes capital, but he’s not able to land
 Silicon Valley capital (at least not yet).
2. Because he’s chosen a “boil the ocean” strategy (getting, say,
Starbucks or Amazon to adopt his technology) he’s finding it hard to get
adoption.  3. Because he doesn’t have adoption, investors aren’t
interested.  4. Plus he’s going against big companies (PayPal, Visa, MC,
American Express) which makes investors nervous, unless you have a clear
differentiator that’ll be defendable for some time.
 Compare his story to Omar Hamoui’s story, CEO of Admob, a mobile
 advertising network. He walked into Sequoia Capital and had a term
 sheet in his hands in about 24 hours. I interviewed him yesterday, and
 we’ll have his story of how he did that up on FastCompany.tv in a few
 weeks (we start our daily video show tomorrow, and have about three
 weeks of shows stored on our Seagate hard drives right now).  How did
 Admob land the capital it needed?  1. They had customers and rapid
 growth BEFORE they walked onto Sand Hill Road.
2. They didn’t try to boil the ocean, nor did they try to go up against
entrenched competitors.  3. One thing common is both picked the
rapidly-growing world of mobile.
 Anyway, it’ll be interesting to see if Andrew gets any feedback based
 on the 18-minute conversation we had this morning on Qik. My feedback
 to him?  Instead of trying to get in front of the CEO of Visa,
 Starbucks, Facebook, or getting a VC like Sequoia, or even an investor
 like Jeff Clavier to pay attention to him, I’d do some new work. I’d
 hang out at Stanford with Dave McClure, who teaches a Facebook class
 there. If Andrew gets a couple of Facebook app developers to build his
 payment techology into their apps, then he’d have something to show
 investors. Plus, he’d probably have millions of people trying his
 technology and he’d be able to learn from their usage model.
 Translation: don’t try to boil the ocean, just pick off a small bucket
 of water, boil that first, then work on the ocean later.  What do you
 think?  Either way, it’s pretty rare that entrepreneurs let you look
 into an early-stage company and some of the challenges that it faces
 trying to get a new idea and a new company started.

  I’ve been talking to lots of people about Twitter. Why is it so
  addictive? Why do new tools, shipped for it, like Quotably was
  tonight, get passed around so fast and talked about so much?
 I’ve gone through stages with Twitter. At some point I thought it was
 important to get lots of followers. But lately I’ve been telling people
 that the secret to Twitter isn’t how many followers you have, but how
 many people you are following. Tonight Sheryl asked me to explain more:
 “why is the secret how many people you follow? Why is it important to
 follow so many people?” Here’s why: 1. Getting followed just means
 you’re popular. Yes, that’s cool, but it hardly will make you
 interesting. Paris Hilton will have more Twitter members than I will,
 when she joins.
2. Getting followed a lot might mean you’re using it for a publishing
system. If all you have is followers what makes that different from
owning a newspaper, a radio station, a TV station, or, even, a Web site?
Hint: nothing.  3. If you’re just trying to get followed you’re probably
just needing attention or you might be Jason Calacanis.
 But what does following a lot of people say?  1. You’re trying to learn
 more.
2. You’re trying to meet more people.  3. You’re trying to be a better
listener.  4. You’re communicating to the world that you’d like to be
listened to (golden rule: treat people how you’d like to be treated).
5. You’re trying to find out about more stuff. More events. More
stories.
 Now, who would you rather hang out with? A person who only talks and
 doesn’t listen? Or a person who listens to as many people as he can?  I
 know I’d rather hang out with someone who listens to more people.  Oh,
 yeah, and many of us on Twitter have been getting messages like what
 Mike Arrington got tonight. Now, I really don’t care about people who
 unfollow me anymore. Go ahead. Doesn’t make me feel bad. But the more
 people I follow, the smarter I get, the more connected I get, the
 better the experiences I have in life (see previous post).  So, that’s
 my new story. The secret to Twitter is how many people are you
 listening to, not how many people are listening to you.  Agree or
 disagree?

  On a week when Microsoft landed a big deal to put Silverlight on Nokia
  phones, Apple’s CEO, Steve Jobs, tells Adobe that there won’t be Flash
  on the iPhone.
 This is a real bummer for Adobe and many users and developers, because
 most of the world’s casual games are written for Flash. Just go over to
 game site Kongregate. Or, look at the world’s video like that on
 YouTube (or any other video site like the Qik one that I use on my cell
 phone). Almost all of it is done in Flash. Now developers at those
 sites will need to find some other method to get those games and videos
 onto the iPhone.  This is a HUGE opening for Microsoft to take momentum
 and mind share away from Flash/Flex/AIR with its Silverlight set of
 technologies (which, based on my Twitter conversations, is winning
 developers over at a pretty good pace).  So, what is Steve thinking? He
 probably didn’t want to hand control of developers to another company,
 but Apple might also have had concerns about battery life or it just
 might not have been able to make Flash work well on the iPhone. I can’t
 believe that Apple couldn’t find a way to make these things work,
 though. Flash isn’t that heavyweight, it might have taken some
 committment on behalf of Apple to rewrite Flash to work and it sounds
 like Apple wants to go the way of SVG (it has long been rumored to be
 working on SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics, which is an open W3C
 standard) for the iPhone).  The inside story has yet to be told on this
 one. Not that Adobe is in a place to retaliate by only doing something
 like future versions of Photoshop or Illustrator on Windows or Linux
 (which would hurt Apple, but would hurt Adobe itself in its real war
 with Microsoft) but Adobe has got to be smarting from this decision
 this morning. After all it was Adobe that helped solidify the
 Macintosh’s role in the world with its desktop publishing, fonts, and
 Postscript technologies.  Does this put a death blow onto the
 Flash/Flex/AIR teams? No, but it certainly does cripple their chances
 against Microsoft’s Silverlight. I’ll be at Microsoft’s Mix conference
 later today to report on that angle.  UPDATE: Microsoft’s keynote this
 morning at its sold-out Mix conference will be webcast live, Neowin is
 reporting. I’m hearing there’s some news coming there, and also later
 in the afternoon.

  Jason Calacanis has started a big argument where Duncan Riley over at
  TechCrunch has stood up for slackers everywhere (he couches it in
  language of “pro family” in the family/life balance). The thing is,
  Duncan might talk to his boss, Mike Arrington. Did Mike get to where
  he is by slacking off and hanging out with his friends and having a
  “real life?” No. He worked his ass off. I’ve caught Mike on several
  occasions working until 3 a.m. or later. And he still is doing that
  work ethic. Of course, that hard work pays off: Mike was on the
  Charlie Rose show this week.
 I’ve been in several startups and have witnessed first hand the
 ascerbic aspects that slackers bring. Believe me, this is the #1 killer
 of startups. If you don’t get rid of unproductive people (or even
 better, avoid hiring them in the first place) your startup will go
 down.  Jason also told me about two employees who’d be outside smoking
 while the rest of the company was working hard during lunches. He fired
 those two. Why? They weren’t team players.  Another killer I’ve seen?
 Assholes. Every entrepreneur should read “The No Asshole Rule.“ But, to
 Jason Calacanis’ point, how do startups save money? I’m practicing one
 right now: share hotel rooms. It’s a pain in the ass, yes, but it sure
 stretches that travel budget further. At CES one year I even stayed a
 night in a Hostel. This was while I was working at Microsoft and could
 have spent $400 a night on a hotel room (I don’t recommend going THAT
 cheap, by the way — you need to be able to lock people out of your
 stuff).

  UPDATE: I just spent an hour talking with Sarah Lacy and apologized
  directly to her, and then we had an interesting talk about the
  industry, sexism, her interview and why she took the line of
  questioning that she did, and her perspective. I highly recommend you
  read Brian Solis’ post following up on this interview, because it
  gives her perspective and matched what I learned from her (that the
  SXSW conference planners wanted her not to take audience questions,
  wanted her to take the interview in a more business-centric direction
  because Facebook had a separate developer-centric event at SXSW, etc).
  Anyway, there’s lots of lessons here for everyone involved. Me,
  audience, Sarah, conference planners, etc. Dave Winer and I discussed
  it on a podcast this morning too.
 +++ When I arrived 15-minutes into the now famous interview of Mark
 Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, by BusinessWeek reporter Sarah Lacy the
 audience had already turned (it was two days ago and it still is the #1
 topic of conversation on blogs and at SXSW, which is the conference
 that this happened at). Usually I try to get to these things early, and
 sit up front, but I had other interviews and things going on and I’d
 already been warned that there wouldn’t be any real news at this event.
 Facebook is working on some major new features, but they simply aren’t
 ready to show off in public. I’m already hearing rumors of another F8
 event (last year’s event, where Facebook first showed off its
 application platform, seems like it was 10 years ago, which tells us a
 little bit about how our expectations for instant gratification are
 increasing).  I arrived in the overflow room because I already knew
 from watching Twitter that the main hall was packed. When I walked in I
 met people leaving already and I could tell they weren’t leaving to go
 to the bathroom. They were leaving in protest. My friend Francine
 Hardaway wrote later that she walked out in disgust. Susan Bratton was
 so disappointed that she wrote four blog posts about it.  I found a
 seat and asked the guy next to me how it was going. “Not well, it’s
 really boring,” was the answer.  I listened for a few more minutes and
 watched the audience reaction and realized that it wasn’t just boring
 but that the audience was building up hostility toward what was going
 on at the video screen.  But let’s back up. I refrained from blogging
 about this because I then became part of the story, due to my Twitter
 stream. Here, let’s look at that now: 12:43 p.m. March 9:  Zuckerberg
 is giving lots of PR answers. Lacy is asking too many business
 questions. (this is about 45 minutes into the interview, if I remember
 right).  12:47:  lacy needs to study guy Kawasaki. His interview of
 ballmer was 1000 times better 12:53: Twitterer’s hate Lacy.  12:58:
 Sarah Lacy lost control of the interview because she just isn’t very
 good. Twitter is going crazy with critiques.  01:00:  @markwallace Lacy
 didn’t do her homework on the audience. This is a
 geek/designer/creative audience. Not one focused on business.  01:01:
 They want to hear about APIs and platforms and what Facebook is going
 to do.  01:01:  She is totally getting defensive now, really poor
 empathy for the audience.  01:02:  The audience as getting outright
 hostile toward Lacy and she basically asked audience to send her a
 message about why she sucked.  01:04:  The audience is asking
 Zuckerburg better questions than Lacy did. Totally agree with @heiko.
 01:06:  @techcrunch I know Zuckerberg is no easy interview. But yours
 was far far far better than Sarah’s.  01:07:  @techcrunch she totally
 lost control of the interview and had no clue how she was coming
 across. Still doesn’t “I thought it was going well.  And on it went.
 Onstage it went worse. Audience members had taken over the interview
 and Lacy made things worse by trying to argue with them about how well
 the interview was going. The audience had decided that it wasn’t going
 well. Later Lacy rubbed it in, by Twittering: “seriously screw all you
 guys. I did my best to ask a range of things.” She also went on YouTube
 to try to explain what happened to her from her perspective.  We had
 turned into assholes. It wasn’t just the back of the room, either. Nor
 was it just the overflow room. People in the front of the room were
 yelling out questions. The entire audience erupted for a 26-second
 applause line when Zuckerberg asked Lacy to ask questions (which
 confused Lacy, because she was unaware that the audience had been
 turning against her).  The audience turned into assholes was the
 conclusion of Mike Arrington, founder of Tech Crunch, who, wrote a
 post, saying this was nothing more than a witch burning.  Some other
 analysis: Jemima Kiss in the Guardian’s blogs: The peculiar Mark
 Zuckerberg keynote interview.  College professor and famous blogger,
 Jeff Jarvis, had the most accurate early analysis that I could find in
 a post titled: Zuckerberg interview: What went wrong.  Brian Solis
 spent five hours with Lacy after the interview and did a bunch more
 reporting before writing a very long, but most excellent, analysis of
 the events. He also explains why Sarah Lacy was the interviewer, and
 gives many details about the friendship between Zuckerberg and Lacy.
 My thoughts?  1. This interview was doomed before it happened. Several
 of my friends didn’t go because they already knew there wouldn’t be any
 news. After all, if there was going to be news, Kara Swisher would have
 reported it and she would have been invited to have been there. We also
 knew that Zuckerberg probably would be boring (he reminds us of Bill
 Gates who, despite giving speeches for 30 years, is still boring). The
 expectations on Zuckerberg are so high now, that he’d have to do
 something like Ballmer’s Monkey Boy dance to meet them.  2. The
 muttering continues, even last night. In fact, one woman, who I won’t
 name here, is going to moderate a panel discussion today and she told
 me “I hope I don’t pull a Lacy.” Overall, now that the emotion is out
 of it for the most part, people are still saying this was an interview
 gone bad and are disappointed that Lacy lashed out at the audience
 instead of trying to figure out what they wanted.  3. Zuckerberg
 himself, yesterday, realized that he didn’t answer the questions the
 audience wanted to have answered, so he did a “redo” of the interview,
 this time with just him in front of an audience. The consensus there is
 that this one went much better for both Zuckerberg and the audience.
 4. There is quite a bit of sexism that is a subtext here. Lots of
 people in the hallways commented on her choice of clothing (she wore a
 short skirt that made her legs very prominently displayed). And on n
 her flirtatious behavior (she twirled her hair, many people told me
 afterward, like a schoolgirl in love). I tried to ignore this, but I
 now am pretty sure that if a guy were doing the interview, and did just
 as badly, that the audience wouldn’t have turned on him so harshly.
 This was amplified by her constant bringing up of personal situations
 (she bragged that she was hanging out with Zuckerberg at a party the
 night before).  5. Several people last night thought this was great PR
 for Lacy, noting that her book sales had gone up, and that now everyone
 knew who she was and, even, felt a little bad for her, so that’ll lead
 to increased attention next time she does an interview. I sort of agree
 with that analysis, noting that I’ve had a bad time on stage, too (at
 LeWeb several years ago our keynote was generally panned and the
 audience got a little hostile toward us there too — that didn’t stop me
 from being asked to do more speeches, and, in fact, made me a better
 speaker).  6. Zuckerberg himself is a very tough interview. Why? Cause
 Zuckerberg is no Gary Vaynerchuk or Guy Kawasaki. In fact, Zuckerberg
 is a geek who is far more comfortable talking about memcache or
 architectures than he is in answering questions for the press, or being
 in front of audiences (although I thought he stepped up his game in
 yesterday’s Q&A quite a bit). He reminds me a LOT of Bill Gates. I
 remember meeting Bill Gates at a conference party in the mid-1990s and
 couldn’t get him to be social, but when I switched to talking to him
 about compilers he got very passionate and went on for 20 minutes about
 the topic. Same with Zuckerberg. He really isn’t that comfortable
 talking about his business, or other things, but when you start digging
 into him technically he comes alive.  7. Zuckerberg is also a tough
 interview cause he gives PR answers. Now we know one other guy who does
 that: Steve Ballmer. But notice how Guy Kawasaki gets Ballmer to knock
 it off in this video of their interview on stage at Microsoft’s Mix08
 conference: he calls Ballmer on the bullshit. Compare this interview to
 the one that Lacy did, and you’ll see how to do an interview with a CEO
 well, and poorly.  8. This wasn’t the only audience revolt at SXSW this
 year.  9. The audience at SXSW is quite unlike any other. These are
 people who blog and Twitter and Facebook and Meebo and use tons of
 other social networking tools. They also are snarky and are used to
 being heard (egotistical, even, just like your friendly local blogger).
 So, when they are in audiences here they expect to be part of the
 event. Most speakers here know this, and take advantage of the
 interactive demands (I was watching Twitter and videoing my own panel
 yesterday, so I knew when our panel was getting boring, or wasn’t on
 track with what the audience wanted). Most speakers here take the pulse
 of the audience often and early, going to questions and such. I
 wouldn’t speak here if you haven’t attended before. Also, this is not a
 business audience. Most of us really don’t care whether Zuckerberg is
 worth $1 or $15 billion. We want to know what Facebook’s developer
 platform is going to do. Or how Facebook is going to give us more
 control over our privacy. Or, how Facebook is going to make our data
 portable (I asked Zuckerberg about my getting kicked off of Facebook
 yesterday in his QA session and several attendees came up to me
 afterward saying they were happy someone finally asked Zuckerberg about
 that).  10. I’m going to try to interview Sarah Lacy, and I’ll
 apologize for my part in being an audience asshole, but I’ll also
 explain to her why I’d do it again. I hate being captive in an audience
 when the people on stage don’t have a feedback loop going with the
 audience. We’re used to living a two-way life online and expect it when
 in an audience too. Our expectations of speakers and people on stage
 have changed, for better or for worse.  Anyway, I’m sure we could
 continue discussing this for a long time, but I have to prepare for
 another panel discussion this afternoon that I was added to (come and
 heckle me, er, be an audience asshole!) Right after that panel we’ll go
 for BBQ with about 100 people. I hope Sarah comes along, we’ll break
 bread. Either way, we can fit about 120 people in, so meet us there.
 Afterward we’ll go to the RockBand party (wait until you see the video
 I participated in!) and then onto the Digg party.


 A year ago, I announced a partnership with my friends at Oddica to take
 over production and shipping of Daring Fireball t-shirts. It’s worked
 out great — better shirts, better print quality, fun packaging, and,
 when shirts are in stock, much faster shipping times than when I was
 handling fulfillment myself.

 The only problem has been with the “when shirts are in stock” part.
 What I should have done last year is what I’m doing now: only selling
 shirts during periodic promotions, after which I’ll order enough new
 shirts to cover the newly-placed batch of orders. After that, no shirt
 orders until the next promotion.

 I’ll take orders now through the end of March next week. All orders
 should be printed and shipped by the end of April. This includes a slew
 of shirts that were ordered during the previous few months. All pending
 orders will ship first, once new shirts arrive from the printer.

 To be clear: It is my fault, not Oddica’s, that I continued to accept
 orders for out-of-stock shirts months in advance of the new print runs.
 Switching to periodic shirt promotions will keep this from happening
 again.

 April also marks the two-year anniversary of my going full-time with
 Daring Fireball. A year ago, I wrote:


   Many of you have written to say that the difference since I’ve gone
  full-time has been both noticeable and welcome: more articles along
  with a more consistent and steady pace to the Linked List. The funny
  part about these messages is that most of them end by thanking me, as
  in, Hey, I’ve really been digging Daring Fireball since you took it
  pro last year. Thanks for making it such an enjoyable site to read.

   I say, thank you. Thank you for reading Daring Fireball, and, to
  those of you who have become members and purchased t-shirts, thank you
  for making this possible. The membership system is the primary source
  of revenue for Daring Fireball. This web site is better because of
  you.


 Unlike last year, the membership system no longer constitutes the
 majority of this site’s revenue; however, it’s still a significant
 part. My original (years ago) goal was to take this site full-time
 based on nothing but direct reader support; that didn’t work out, but
 membership revenue, to me, remains the purest form of support. I’m
 pretty proud of what I’ve accomplished with Daring Fireball: a
 self-published, profitable web site for which I never borrowed any
 money, and have accepted only a modicum of advertising. This has only
 been possible because of the direct support of readers like you.

 Now that DF’s main (free) feed is full-content, there isn’t as much
 differentiation between it and the members-only feeds, but many members
 still use them. (One good reason is that you can subscribe to separate
 feeds for articles and Linked List entries.) The member feeds contain
 an automated reminder when your membership is about to expire, and a
 bunch of you have already renewed for another year. My sincere thanks.

 This passage from a reader email pretty much nails it:


   Yes, it would make a difference if the checkbox for Safari were
  unchecked by default.  Also, the “new installs” should be visually
  separated from the “updates to programs you’ve already installed”, and
  clearly marked as such.  I’m all in favor of programs updating
  themselves — especially potentially network-exploitable apps like
  iTunes or QuickTime — but companies shouldn’t abuse that to push
  entirely unrelated software on end users.


 The reason reactions to this controversy have been so polarized is that
 we’ve been mostly arguing about the wrong thing: how or whether Apple
 should offer new applications to Windows users via the current Software
 Update app. The problem is with the design of the Software Update app
 itself.

 The reader is right: updates to currently-installed software are an
 entirely different thing than offers to install new software. Different
 things should look different; the current design of Software Update
 doesn’t allow for such a visual differentiation.

 For updates to installed software, the simple plain list Software
 Update currently displays is perfect. New software — like, in this
 case, Safari — should be displayed separately and more prominently. A
 big app icon alongside a brief description, perhaps — something that,
 visually, is instantly recognizable as something different from the
 regular updates. It should be clear that what’s being offered is both
 new and optional. The default should be not to install — or, perhaps,
 the user could be required to explicitly click either “Install” or
 “Don’t Install”, with neither option selected by default. If the user
 chooses “Don’t Install”, Software Update should then offer the user the
 option to never again be prompted about this particular application.
 (You can do this now, using the “Ignore Update” command in the Update
 menu, but this feature should not be hidden in a menu.)

 Maybe Apple realizes this, but they figured it wasn’t worth the effort
 to add an entirely new presentation mode to the Software Update app,
 because they don’t have any other new Windows apps on the horizon.
 I.e., that, given their current plans, it wouldn’t be a new “ask the
 user if they want this brand new app installed” feature, but rather,
 for all intents and purposes, really just an “ask the user if they want
 Safari” feature.

 But laziness is no excuse. This entire controversy, minuscule though it
 may be, could — and should — have been avoided if Apple had followed
 the design principle of making things that are different look
 different.





You know the feeling. It's happened to all of us at some point: you've
pored over the code a dozen times and still can't find a problem with
it. But there's some bug or error you can't seem to get rid of. There
just has to be something wrong with the machine you're coding on, with
the operating system you're running under, with the tools and libraries
you're using. There just has to be!

No matter how desperate you get, don't choose that path. Down that path
lies voodoo computing and programming by coincidence. In short, madness.

It's frustrating to repeatedly bang your head against difficult, obscure
bugs, but don't let desperation lead you astray. An essential part of
being a humble programmer is realizing that whenever there's a problem
with the code you've written, it's always your fault.  This is aptly
summarized in The Pragmatic Programmer  as "Select Isn't Broken":


In most projects, the code you are debugging may be a mixture of
application code written by you and others on your project team,
third-party products (database, connectivity, graphical libraries,
specialized communications or algorithms, and so on) and the platform
environment (operating system, system libraries, and compilers).

It is possible that a bug exists in the OS, the compiler, or a
third-party product-- but this should not be your first thought. It is
much more likely that the bug exists in the application code under
development. It is generally more profitable to assume that the
application code is incorrectly calling into a library than to assume
that the library itself is broken. Even if the problem does lie with a
third party, you'll still have to eliminate your code before submitting
the bug report.

We worked on a project where a senior engineer was convinced that the
select system call was broken on Solaris. No amount of persuasion or
logic could change his mind (the fact that every other networking
application on the box worked fine was irrelevant). He spent weeks
writing workarounds, which, for some odd reason, didn't seem to fix the
problem. When finally forced to sit down and read the documentation on
select, he discovered the problem and corrected it in a matter of
minutes. We now use the phrase "select is broken" as a gentle reminder
whenever one of us starts blaming the system for a fault that is likely
to be our own.


The flip side of code ownership is code responsibility. No matter what
the problem is with your software-- maybe it's not even your code in the
first place-- always assume the problem is in your code and act
accordingly. If you're going to subject the world to your software, take
full responsibility for its failures. Even if, technically speaking, you
don't have to. That's how you earn respect and credibility. You
certainly don't earn respect or credibility by endlessly pawning off
errors and problems on other people, other companies, other sources.

Statistically, you understand, it is incredibly rare for any bugs or
errors in your software not to be your fault. In Code Complete, Steve
McConnell cited two studies that proved it:


A pair of studies performed [in 1973 and 1984] found that, of total
errors reported, roughly 95% are caused by programmers, 2% by systems
software (the compiler and the operating system), 2% by some other
software, and 1% by the hardware. Systems software and development tools
are used by many more people today than they were in the 1970s and
1980s, and so my best guess is that, today, an even higher percentage of
errors are the programmers' fault.


Whatever the problem with your software is, take ownership. Start with
your code, and investigate further and further outward until you have
definitive evidence of where the problem lies. If the problem lies in
some other bit of code that you don't control, you'll not only have
learned essential troubleshooting and diagnostic skills, you'll also
have an audit trail of evidence to back up your claims, too. This is
certainly a lot more work than shrugging your shoulders and pointing
your finger at the OS, the tools, or the framework-- but it also
engenders a sense of trust and respect you're unlikely to achieve
through fingerpointing and evasion.

If you truly aspire to being a humble programmer, you should have no
qualms about saying "hey, this is my fault-- and I'll get to the bottom
of it."

This is an e-mail that I wrote to my friend, Hollywood animator Sari
Gennis.  I wrote it while I was a graduate  student in   Physics at UC
Santa Cruz, and was also working as a programmer.     I was manic when I
wrote this - I meant to write just a brief note and ended up writing for
twelve hours.  During this manic episode I was experiencing peculiar
irregularities and disclocations in time and space.  My experience of
the time I spent writing this was that perhaps an hour had passed.  As I
wrote, I made cup after cup of tea - it seemed to me that when I put the
water on the stove that it would burst into a boil instantly.  I was
also eating bananas.  By the end of my writing I had eaten the whole
bunch and was suddenly surprised to see a large pile of banana peels
appear next to me on the table.    I wrote this on a Sunday, while still
in the pleasant part of mania.  The following Friday I was in the mental
hospital, hallucinating and paranoid.  I was in for four days.  I took a
few days off after that and then went back to work at Working Software.

 I love the alphabet and the fact that it has an order. There's no
 reason for the order of the letters, but there you go.

 With computers, though, alphabetical order is almost always a bad idea,
 even chronological order doesn't work perfectly.

 Example: When I look through my spam folder, I shouldn't see the notes
 in chrono order or alphabetical by sender (with AAAA' going first...).
 No, I should see the notes in order of least likely to be spam to most
 likely. Right? (book tip: Everything is Miscellaneous).

 Example: When I do a search in Google images, I want them sorted by
 relevance and then, within that, by size. Bigger is better.

 Bookstores really don't have much choice. They need to alphabetize the
 books so you'll know that you'll find me in the Gs, near Malcolm
 Gladwell. But Amazon has no business using the alphabet, because almost
 any other ordering technique makes more sense.

 Going to alpha by default is lazy and ineffective and expensive.

 Why does my Sonos make me start browsing my music collection with Abba?
 (Phew, I don't have any Abba, but you get the idea). Wouldn't it make
 more sense to show me, "music you haven't heard lately that's similar
 to music you've been listening to" first?

 Your address book is in alphabetical order, right? Why? If you want to
 look someone up, type the name in. Alpha is least useful way to browse
 4,000 names in an address book. I want them sorted by recency of
 contact, or in tickler-file order.

 If I knew that lists of blogs in blog readers would be in alpha, I
 would have changed my name.

 Your data files, your product catalog... none of it should be in
 alphabetical order.

 The one exception is the name of ski slopes. Ski slopes should go from
 A to Z, left to right, as you look at the mountain. If someone says,
 "I'll meet you at the top of Montego Bay," you know where that is
 without looking at a map. And, by the way, the difficulty of each slope
 could be coded into the name. Cities could be easiest, animals could be
 blues, and the most difficult slopes could be named after disgraced
 politicians....

 Don't get me started.


Why do [some] people struggling for an income end up using an expensive
check cashing service when the bank right next door will let them have a
checking account for free?

Why do [some] students spend an hour fighting about their homework
instead of ten minutes just doing it?

Why do customers fall for slick come ons or fancy financing instead of
buying what's best for them?

Why is it so easy to fool voters with patently false accusations?

Why do some people turn a routine traffic stop into a life-endangering
argument with the cop?

Why can't worthy charities (with dreary stories) raise more money than
they do?

 I think in every case the answer is the same: Internal noise. [I got a
 few notes about check cashing services, by the way. In many cities,
 there are banks that have sensible policies for low income customers,
 and most jobs that use a payroll service like ADP offer direct deposit.
 The combination would save a large number of people a lot of time and
 money, and my point isn't that there are enough financial services
 available to the less fortunate (there aren't) but that if it weren't
 for a fear of banks, plenty more people would take advantage of the
 services that are available. $5 a week for check cashing might account
 for 30% of someone's disposal income, which is a sin.]

 My friend Lisa was on a plane once and her seatmate kept looking at
 her. She finally said, "Is the noise inside my head bothering you?"

 Just about everyone has noise inside their head. It's a noise that
 keeps them from being rational, that forces them to avoid the simple
 truths sometimes, that makes them unable to take a shortcut when a long
 (more emotional one) is available.  Emotional intelligence (EQ) gives
 us a way to talk about how people navigate the world. Far more
 important than IQ in most settings, emotional intelligence can be
 learned, but it rarely is. My take is that not only is it important for
 dealing with work and personal situations, it also makes you a better
 consumer of marketing.

 If you as a marketer(/fundraiser/teacher/blogger/salesperson/parent)
 are assuming that all the citizens in your audience have genius level
 EQ, you're almost certainly making a mistake and you're paying for it
 every day.

 It’s 7pm in Austin Texas and I’m in a deserted lobby at South by
 Southwest with Nick Gonzalez from TechCrunch. Tomorrow is the day we’ve
 been building up to for ten months, the day we launch our product,
 Clickpass. I’m now demoing Clickpass to Nick who wants to review it for
 TechCrunch.  Almost everyone has left the building and are either back
 in their hotels or at the Facebook party, but for some reason the
 wireless is still saturated and has almost slowed to a halt.

 On this grindingly slow network, our homepage hardly loads. When it
 ﬁnally does — in an irony not lost on either of us — Nick can’t
 remember the password he created six months ago when he last tried
 Clickpass and has to try several times to get back in.  Clickpass was
 designed to make single-sign-on easy. Before someone starts using it,
 though, they need to connect it to their sites.  The connection process
 is not going well. It’s been a while since Nick’s used any of the sites
 we support and we cycle through yet more password attempts as we try to
 hook into them. We ﬁnally manage to connect up to one of them but, for
 no apparent reason, Hacker News keeps failing. The demo part of the
 interview winds up and we get stuck into talking about the business
 instead. I’m starting to feel decidedly nervous.
Storm clouds gather
 Ten months earlier we left London, moved to Boston to join YCombinator
 and started work on Clickpass — which was back then called Remember Me.
 We ﬁrmly believed that OpenID was one of the most important things to
 happen to the web and that the core issue standing between a brilliant
 protocol and widespread adoption was its unintuitive usability.  At the
 time we started the work of evangelists like Simon Willison, David
 Recordon, Chris Messina and Scott Kveton have succeeded in making most
 of the technology community aware of the protocol, but there was still
 a lot of cynicism and doubt.  As 2008 began and Yahoo and Google both
 announced their support for OpenID, something began to change.  Earlier
 that day, the SXSW OpenID session had been standing room only. Despite
 being in a sizeable room, every seat was taken and people were being
 turned away at the door as others stood around the walls and down the
 aisle.  That afternoon in a panel-session on distributed social
 networks, someone in the audience stood up and asked how OpenID was
 going to become easier to use. Following a mention from Jeremy Keith
 (moderating) almost the entire panel complemented our about-to-launch
 product.  It was a huge room, with hundreds of people and I could
 hardly believe it as Leslie Chicoine from GetSatisfaction described
 Clickpass as the “ﬁrst time that OpenID’s actually made sense”.  Back
 at the demo now with Nick, in the middle of what seemed to be brewing
 into a perfect tech-storm, but with our ship still side-on to the wind.
 We ﬁnish up the interview and Nick heads back to his hotel room to
 write up while I hop next door to use the wireless in the Hilton.
Final tweaks
 As the night wore on, many of the problems started to fall away. It
 turned out that the fact we couldn’t connect to Hacker News was
 indirectly because the site had, by complete coincidence, been
 TechCrunched that day.  The massive trafﬁc had revealed a registration
 bug that was slowing the login system to a standstill. Had it it not
 been TechCrunched, the same bug would have killed the Clickpass
 experience the day after. By 10pm though Paul Graham had posted that it
 was ﬁxed and the site was back to normal. Sometimes you just get lucky.
March 11th — day of launch
 1am: Immad has crushed every bug we can ﬁnd, our four servers are all
 idling happily and I’m about to head back to my hotel when I get an
 email from Nick saying that he’s sent the piece to Mike Arrington, but
 that Mike wants to ask us some questions. Can I hang on to take a call?
 2am: I’ve just uploaded the company details to CrunchBase as requested
 when Mike Arrington calls. We talk for almost two hours about
 Clickpass, about the pains it’s solving, about how it takes the
 confusion out of OpenID.  As an entrepreneur you spend a lot of your
 time explaining things to people who aren’t always paying a lot of
 attention. However, Mike is 100% engaged throughout the full two hours
 and totally focused on understanding the product. I’m impressed.  Mike
 hasn’t used OpenID that much though and at the end of the interview
 he’s still keen to publish the story but feels we need something more
 to explain our unique selling point.  He advises me to produce a
 screencast and hold back from the prescribed 9am embargo for a couple
 of hours until it’s ready. We ﬁnish up and I leave him with an article
 from Marshall Kirkpatrick highlighting the difﬁculties around OpenID.
 4:10am: I email Chris Messina and arrange to do a screencast with him
 the next morning. Chris is great at explaining these things and drawing
 out their signiﬁcance in a way that people get.  4:20am: Take a taxi
 back to the hotel.  5am: Bed.
Launch morning
 8am: Get up and promptly ﬁeld a call from Joseph Smarr at Plaxo. With
 tens of millions of users, Plaxo are by far our biggest launch partner
 and the integration is yet to go live. Joseph’s hit a couple of small
 bugs at our end and and works with Immad back in SF to iron them out.
 SF is two hours behind Austin so it’s 6:30am over there and we’ve still
 got a bit of time before the 9am PST publication embargo.  At this
 stage I’m still expecting TechCrunch to hold the article until 11, when
 they get the screencast, and assume we’ve probably got a couple of
 extra hours more on top.  Joseph tells me that Techcrunch is twittering
 our imminent launch. After 10 months of designing, documenting and
 building it’s hard to believe it’s all really happening.  9:30am: SXSW
 convention center — I ﬁnd a table and start testing all of the partner
 sites making sure everything is doing what it should be doing. Immad is
 doing the same back in San Francisco. David our designer is producing a
 “We’ll be back soon” page in case anything goes wrong.  Plaxo has
 pushed their code live and our little button is now on the bottom of
 their site. Nobody can see it until we drop our beta-cookie, but it’s
 there, and ready to switch on for their 40M users.  Disqus.com is
 looking good. Simon Willison’s Django OpenID libraries are blazing fast
 and Hacker News is now back to normal loading time. Plaxo is as fast as
 ever.  10:30am: With everything looking good I start getting to grips
 with the screencast software and mail Chris to ﬁx up a place to meet.
 11:25am: As I shut my Mac and go to do the screencast I happen to
 glance at TechCrunch. We’re on. Top story. No comments. It seems
 Marshall’s OpenID critique hit the spot. It’s an incredible review —
 everything we could have hoped for. Fantastic, except that we didn’t
 expect this for another two hours and the site’s still behind a
 password!

 11:25am 10s: I call San Francisco: “Immad, we’re live, TechCrunch just
 published the story — let’s push!” 11:25am and 30s: <ping> Aral Balkan
 twitters that he can’t see the site — how do people ﬁnd these things
 out so quickly?!  11:26am: Immad, as fast as ever, IM’s to say that
 everything’s live. Clickpass is go.  11:37am: An email arrives kindly
 offering to sell me Clickpass.cn. Un. Believable. I start buying other
 countries.

 11:40am: Joseph publishes a great post about us on the Plaxo blog. I
 can’t help feeling a ﬂush of pride.  11:50am: 50 new registrations on
 the site. Congratulatory emails and twitters start coming in. We’re the
 top story on Hacker News.  2pm: 300 registrations. The trafﬁc is
 ramping up but thanks to Martin, our sys-admin, the servers don’t even
 blink at the extra load.  2:40pm: I call Immad and David back in the
 ofﬁce. Everyone is excited and so far, everything’s holding strong. I
 tell the guys that there’s a bottle of champagne waiting for them in
 the bottom of the fridge.  3pm: <ping> — twitters keep coming in. I
 didn’t use Twitter much before SXSW but am amazed at what an incredible
 realtime snapshot it gives of the early-adopter web. Most are positive
 but a couple of people don’t really get what we’re doing. There’s
 clearly still work to be done.

 3:30pm: An email comes in from one of our new users asking if they can
 join the company.  3:40pm: And another.  4pm: We make it onto Techmeme
 and one of our new users has already written a brilliant blog post
 about us.

 5pm: 600 registrations. The adrenaline is starting to wear off and I
 suddenly feel exhausted. Draft an email to investors to bring them up
 to speed and realise that we haven’t even emailed our pre-launch list
 to tell them we’re live yet.
Lock-down
 5:30pm: We haven’t set up our email marketing software yet so after
 writing up an email of the day’s events, I check, double-check and
 check again that I’ve put 1000 email addresses into the BCC and not the
 CC ﬁeld on GMail.  GMail won’t take 1,000 emails at a time so I split
 them down into chunks. First chunk — okay. Second chunk — okay.  Write
 an email to another friend thanking them for their support. Send.
 “GMail has detected an unusually high volume of mails being sent from
 this account. Access to your account will be frozen for the next 24
 hours”. Bugger.  5:40pm: Phone a friend at Google. Fingers crossed.
 6:10:pm: Hurrah — email back on. Silicon Valley is crazy-connected.
 6:30pm: All of my electronics are about to die. MacBook is ﬂat and
 hard-disk is starting to make strange, not-good, marble-on-a-stone-ﬂoor
 sounds and won’t sleep. iPhone has enough juice left to take a call
 from Joseph suggesting dinner. I catch up with him and John McCrea and
 we dissect the day’s events over Guinness and burgers. It’s a great
 evening and when they head back to their hotels I peal off to join the
 obscenely long queue for the Digg party.  10pm: Immad calls and we
 review everything. We’ve got a couple of glitches in some of the
 ancillary features but the whole core has been as solid as a rock. He’s
 an incredible developer and together with David’s design skills the
 product hasn’t just pleased us but also, it seems, our users too. We’re
 on track to hit 1,000 registrations in the ﬁrst 24 hours and loads of
 people are installing the Wordpress plugin. We agree it was a good day.
The next fortnight
 The ﬁrst couple of weeks have been a bit of a blur of emails, investor
 meetings and bug ﬁxes. They’ve also revealed a ton of work still to do.
 The concept of password-less single sign-on is totally alien to most
 people and Clickpass doesn’t yet do enough to explain things.  We did a
 lot of work to make sure we didn’t contradict the decentralised ideals
 of OpenID and that people can still use their existing OpenID’s with
 us. Even so, feedback and reviews have highlighted that there are still
 things left we can to do to make it easier still for those who want to
 use pure OpenID.  Making OpenID easier is our raison d’etre. I’m
 pleased with just how much we’ve done for users but we’ve now got to
 turn our efforts to developers. Installing OpenID isn’t too difﬁcult
 but it’s intimidating and we need to change that. Over the coming weeks
 and months we’re going to be releasing both libraries and plugins that
 should start to help a lot.
Live on new sites — Ma.gnolia
 We’ve also got more sites coming online and at the same time as this
 article is published, so is our integration with Ma.gnolia.  If you’ve
 not tried Ma.gnolia before it’s a beautifully designed
 social-bookmarking site which, like Plaxo, has also always been on the
 cutting edge of OpenID.  We’re really pleased that people are going to
 be able to use their Clickpass with it.
Celebrating the victories
 There’s an undeniable cult around internet startups and a generous
 helping of hype. As with any other project, 99.8% of the time is spent
 coding, designing, documenting, answering support and making sure the
 ﬁnances stay sound.  When the exciting times do come though, they come
 thick and fast and are exhilarating and nerve-racking all at the same
 time. Launch was exactly like that for us and a day I won’t be
 forgetting anytime soon.  Image credits: Austin is the killer app:

 In this article, I want to introduce you to a really powerful CSS3
 pseudo selector called :target. Much like :hover, :target is invoked
 during certain interactions with the website. Specifically, when
 applied to a fragment identifier. On a page such as
 http://example.com/index.html#hello-world, the id=”hello-world” element
 is the target and any matching :target styles would be applied.  I am
 going to demonstrate two examples of when and how :target can be used.
 Hopefully, this introduction will get you thinking about some of simple
 ways :target can add benefit your customers.
Tabs in CSS
 A well structured document is one that makes sense in the ordering of
 sections and topics. It works well when there is no CSS and no
 JavaScript. Tabbed systems make use of some sort of display tab which
 shows the current section, and in doing so hides the other sections.
 We’ve all seen a tabbed system before, and probably plenty of poor
 implementations as well. Sometimes when you click the tab, it calls a
 JavaScript function to populate the area below the tab. The downside is
 that when there is no JavaScript the data does not appear.  The ideal
 way to build a tab system is to have all your data in the HTML, then
 use JavaScript to hide the other tab panes and build the tabs
 themselves dynamically. That way if there is no JavaScript, it just
 defaults to a linear set of text blocks. This is progressive
 enhancement; build for the lowest common denominator and add more
 functionality and styling as you go — no one is left behind, not even
 googlebot.  Instead of using JavaScript to do this show/hide, it is
 possible to use CSS3 using the :target selector. Before you get too
 excited, it must be said that the :target selector is not supported in
 IE6 or IE7, so the practical uses for this are pretty slim. Instead
 this can be used for user chrome type objects which don’t effect
 functionality, but improve usability. You can add the :target info
 today, and when browsers implementations catch-up they get the bells
 and whistles auto-magically. It is important to not use :target for
 mission critical things, but there are plenty of other possibilities.
 As an example, I will show you how make a simple tab system based on
 Daniel Glazman’s example.  First we should create the basic un-styled
 HTML.
<h2 id="topic1"><a href="#content1">Topic 1</a></h2> <p
id="content1">This is the text for topic 1. Hello World!</p> <h2
id="topic2"><a href="#content2">Topic 2</a></h2> <p
id="content2">Different text for topic 2. Ah, foobar.</p>
 Without CSS or JavaScript this text is completely accessible and reads
 normally, it just makes the page longer. Tabs are a way to compact the
 information into a smaller space, so lets proceed to do this.  If we
 add some simple styles to the page, we can get the two headings to
 appear and act like tabs through positioning. The interesting part is
 the :target selector.
// set the default state first p { display: none; } // When the link is
clicked, set the contents to display p:target { display: block; }

 When the fragment (#content1) is not part of the URL, the :target
 selector does not match the <p> element, so it is set the default view
 of display: none. This is a very simple way to create a tabbed system.
 You can view a working example and see for yourself.
The Yellow Fade Technique
 There is a popular usability feature called the “Yellow Fade
 Technique”. This is used to direct the user’s attention back to a
 specific area subtly. For example, when you want to edit a piece of a
 page you may click edit which takes to a new page with form fields.
 When you press save you are returned to the original page where there
 is a brief yellow fade of the area that was just edited. It brings your
 eye to the area, possibly to confirm the changes look correctly in the
 template, or to just make people aware the change took place at all.
 Either way, it seems to be a welcomed usability feature that has been
 picked-up by several web applications.  Normally, this is accomplished
 through the use of JavaScript and page IDs or classes. The JavaScript
 runs an onload function looking for those classes or ID and once the
 parts of the page have been identified, the script runs a timer and
 ever few microseconds change the background color from pure yellow to
 white. This create a smooth, not too annoying, yellow fade effect.  The
 downside to all this is that there are several resources at work,
 including onload functions (which might be happening every time the
 page loads, not just the times when a form is submitted) and hooks into
 the classes and IDs and JavaScript timers. All this adds to the client
 download and subtracts from the speed of the page.  With CSS3 there is
 a much easier and simpler solution. Using the :target pseudo class it
 is possible to emulate the yellow fade without a single line of
 JavaScript.  First, you need to create (or download) a tiny 1
 pixel-wide yellow animated gif. This will fade from yellow to white.
 The animated gif isn’t repeating, so it will fade once and then stay
 pure white. This also defines the length of the fade, so there is no
 need to for a JavaScript timer.  Second, we need to set this as the
 background image for the area which has been changed. To do this, we
 use the CSS3 :target pseudo selector.
#here:target { background-image: url('yellow-fade.gif'); }

 This will fade the element with an id=”here”, the URL would look like
 http://example.com/#here. It is good web architecture to use fragment
 identifiers for each of your headings and to use RESTful URLs.  Now,
 the downside to that CSS statement is that it will only fade the area
 with the ID.
<h1 id="here">Hello World</h1> <p>I am saying Hello to everyone in the
World!</p>
 Only the heading element would get the yellow fade. So how do we fix
 this? Well, we could change the ID to a class and create something
 like:
.here:target { background-image: url('yellow-fade.gif');
}
 But then on the server, we’d have to add classes dynamically to all our
 elements.
<h1 class="here">Hello World</h1> <p class="here">I am saying Hello to
everyone in the World!</p>
 We could put a wrapper around both the heading and the paragraph.
<div id="here"> <h1>Hello World</h1> <p>I am saying Hello to everyone in
the World!</p> </div>
 But that seems too much work. Instead, we can make use of another CSS
 combinator, the adjacent sibling selector:
#here:target, #here:target+p { background-image: url('yellow-fade.gif');
}
 This targets both the heading with the ID ‘here’ and the first sibling
 paragraph. So both will get the background image and the subsequent
 fade. You can easily change your CSS to fit your HTML design, but this
 is a quick and simple alternative to the Yellow Fade technique in
 JavaScript used on so many sites.  In CSS there is also a wildcard * to
 stand for all nodes. So you could further take the example to
#here:target, #here:target+* { background-image: url('yellow-fade.gif');
}
 This would match the first sibling of #here no matter what the type of
 element it might be. Firefox correctly supports this, but as of
 writing, Safari does not.  You can see an example of this in action and
 view the source to see how it all works.
Blurring the lines between behaviour and presentation
 I am obligated by the behaviorists to mention that there is a debate
 over presentation and behavior, where does one stop and the other
 start? By adding the :target selector into your CSS, you are styling
 the HTML based on the behavior of the browser and the users. We talk
 about the “holy trinity” of web design, and we have spent the last few
 years campaigning to divide data, presentation and behavior into their
 respective HTML, CSS and JavaScript camps. The :target, as well as the
 :hover, selectors blur that line between presentation and behavior.
 Depending on how comfortable or how much of a purist you are, you may
 or may not agree with what has been demonstrated.  These examples were
 written to better understand the CSS3 :target element and to explore
 those blurry grey-areas. Hopefully, a discussion will emerge with even
 more ideas, caveats and problems that were not originally thought of.
 Together we can create some best practices on when to best use CSS
 behavior and JavaScript presentation.
Conclusion
 Over a year ago, Andy Budd demonstrated the yellow-fade technique with
 :target and I was impressed!
 (http://www.andybudd.com/presentations/css3/) In the time in between, I
 have seen very little attention or articles on this little known
 selector. As I was started working on this article, I found several
 examples some from as early as January 2003 that talk about uses for
 the :target selector. The reason for not getting the traction it
 deserves could be the lack of information about when and how to use it
 correctly or documentation on the poor CSS3 implementations in
 browsers.  CSS3 is closer than you think, many of the selectors and
 attributes are available in several major browsers today. They can be
 used with progressive enhancement to add more style to your design at
 little cost, when other browsers catch-up they get the benefits of your
 progressive code for free. The CSS3 :target selector is just one
 example of some of the new selectors arriving that can be taken
 advantage of in interesting new ways.

 Topics we cover in the interview

What’s the creative process behind digg?  How do you think up new
features? Do you use a digg-like consensus approach to them?  How have
you seen digg affect traditional media?  How will digg-spawned sites and
web apps be in the future?

Full transcription of the interview

 SD: Do you do programming as well as design or are you one of the
 individuals who’s able to see the big picture and how the pieces fit
 together?  KR: As far as my daily activities on the site, working for
 digg, it’s all about creating new features for the site, so it’s all
 about working with the graphic designer, Daniel Burka to come up with
 these features. So basically I’ll draw them up on a piece of paper and
 they look really ugly, and then I pass them to someone that knows how
 to make them look pretty, so that’s kind of how it’s been working for
 the last couple of years.  SD: Can you tell us a little bit about your
 creative process?  KR: Well, it’s a very strange one in that most of it
 is done almost randomly, just driving around or whatever it may be, and
 I’ll just think of a feature and how it might impact the users and how
 they might use it. I’m constantly thinking about the site and so it
 doesn’t feel like work, more like a way to figure out how users want to
 communicate and share information with each other. We’ve come up with
 dozens of different features, a lot of them that we’ve thrown away
 because we don’t think they’re a good fit, or features that we just
 haven’t time to build, create and roll them out yet, so it’s really
 looking at how the users are expressing themselves on the site and
 seeing what they are doing with the site, what are the pitfalls? Where
 do they get lost in the navigation? Can they not discover stories
 because of one reason another? Is there a story that falls through the
 cracks because it wasn’t highlighted in a certain way, and how can we
 draw out the best information presented to the users and then give them
 the tools that they need to be able to share it with all of their
 friends using digg?  And so we keep that in mind and think about - I
 know this sounds really strange and basic - but what would be cool and
 useful, what people would really like to do, and what would keep them
 coming back and really finding the information they want to find.  SD:
 Do you use something that’s parallel to digg, where it’s kind of a
 consensus vote into what you feel will actually work? Do you take that
 into your in-house creative process?  KR: Well, it’s really myself and
 Daniel, and so we sit down and we come up with different things and
 eventually we’ll turn them into mockups. So after there’s a design
 that’s been on a piece of scratchpaper it’s handed off to him and he’ll
 come up with a series of different mockups and different layouts for
 that particular feature or design. We’ll take a look at it, then
 present it to the rest of the staff and let them play around with it,
 see what they think about the feature, take their feedback and then
 ultimately we’ll just make the decision on whether we should push it
 out or not.  SD: Do you have demographics on your core users? Who are
 the people that are sitting and spending large chunks of time to vote
 the stories up?  KR: It typically tends to be your standard eighteen to
 thirty-four year old male user for the most part, but there’s different
 types of users on the site, and we’ve really seen that split and
 fragment when we rolled out the new sections in digg version three. For
 the longest time we were a technology news site, so it was all about
 the tech fans and tech enthusiasts, but right after we launched version
 three we saw a huge explosion in user registration and it was from a
 lot of users that don’t fit our typical demographic because they’re
 interested in other types of news online. So the number two most
 popular section on our site today is our political section - those are
 very hot topics, and then actually followed by videos, so videos is our
 first stab at content outside of just news and has been extremely
 popular for us, and it’s been a great way to expose users to a lot of
 cool videos around the web.  SD: Are you finding that larger news
 agencies or advertising agencies are starting to use digg as a poll
 factor?  KR: You know, it’s really shortening the length of the
 feedback loop. It’s one of those things where they are using it to find
 out what is hot at any given moment in time, especially as you can sort
 most diggs in any given section and you can see what people are talking
 about, where they’re gathering around, what stories are very
 interesting for a given day, etc.  I’ve gotten a lot of feedback from
 writers that said, hey, y’know what, I pulled up on the day that Apple
 announced all of their new products, and looked up a digg swarm (which
 is basically a Flash visualisation of all the users as they’re swarming
 around the different stories), and they were able to watch that over
 the course of a few hours and see where the most attention was [and
 work out] which product did they want to focus their article on. They
 found out that it was the iTV, the little set-top box, that was an
 extremely popular story that day and so they created content around
 that because they knew that that was going to be a hot topic. So it’s
 helping journalists and writers in that way, in that they can find out
 in real-time what the pulse is of the community is online.  SD: And how
 about advertising agencies - are they referencing back to digg to see
 how to shape their next story or campaign?  KR: You know, we haven’t
 had a ton of ad agencies contact us, other than the fact that they’ve
 said they would like to have their ads diggable, and I don’t know if
 our users want to digg advertisements! So that’s one of those things
 where I was like, “Can we get back to you on that one?! But not really
 at this time, not that I know of!  SD: What do you think are the
 long-term implications for social content? If we look two or three
 years down the line, what is the digg universe going to look like, what
 are the digg-spawned applications and websites going to look like?  KR:
 Well, I think that digg is a great tool for sharing your interests with
 others, and I think that there has never really been a tool online
 where there’s - I’m trying to think of what I can say and what I can’t
 say! We really want to build out a profile of users’ interests and be
 able to group these together and get recommendations on different
 things based on people that you trust. So whether that be your news, or
 other different types of content online, it’s really about not only
 getting recommendations but suggestions and also introducing you to new
 things that you might not know of through people that you’re connected
 with, and people that you’ve never met.  So one of the things that
 we’re doing at digg right now that’s very exciting to us (that we
 haven’t launched yet) is we’re learning a lot about what individual
 people are digging on the site and so what we really want to do is
 allow the users - I mean, we should do everything in our power to give
 back to the users based upon what they’re giving us. So they’re giving
 us history and they’re sharing their history with everyone based on
 what they’re digging. What we can do is, on the back end, do the math
 to make comparisons to other users and say, ok, based on what you’re
 into, I know you love sports cars and I know you love oolong tea, I can
 make a connection there with other types of stories, and I can also
 make a connection with people that you haven’t met before, so it’s
 going to be really interesting when social networking sites are no
 longer based on just, “I think this person is attractive and I want to
 meet them,” but more along the lines of, “I know I have a connection
 with this person in one way or another because we digg the same
 comments, we like the same stories, and we might even live close to
 each other and might want to meet up,” so there’s going to be a whole
 nice range of tools that we’ll be providing to the community over the
 next year that are going to allow them to explore these relationships
 in ways that they never thought possible.  SD: Very cool. What is the
 relationship between, say, digg and Flickr? Is something like that a
 possibility?  KR: Well, y’know, it’s one of those things where we
 really want to give users the power to digg and share whatever is
 important to them and we’re not limiting that to any one particular
 type of content online so whether it’s pictures or you name it,
 anything where there is an abundance of information that needs a large
 collaborative filter applied to it to sift through that, we’ll be
 going. As long as it’s relevant too, I mean there’s certain things that
 you really wouldn’t want to dig - you couldn’t really apply digg to an
 online dating service because you wouldn’t want to digg someone that
 you’re interested in because then everyone else would want to go out
 with them! So we know there’s limitations to the concept, but there are
 a lot of really cool areas that we can apply the concept to, so you’ll
 see that rolled out, definitely some new areas in the next few months.
 SD: Any last comments?  KR: Thanks for having me, and just thought I’d
 let you know that I’m huge fan of the site and I digg your stories all
 of the time. It’s awesome!  SD: Thanks Kevin.  Transcribed by Scott

 Chemists at the University of California, San Diego have discovered
 that a chemical reaction in the atmosphere above major cities long
 assumed to be unimportant in urban air pollution is in fact a
 significant contributor to urban ozone — the main component of smog.
 Their finding, detailed in the March 21 issue of the journal Science,
 should help air quality experts devise better strategies to reduce
 ozone for the more than 300 counties across the United States with
 ozone levels that exceed new standards announced last week by the
 Environmental Protection Agency.  It should also benefit cities in the
 rest of the world such as Mexico City and Beijing that are now
 grappling with major air quality and urban smog problems. More than 100
 million people worldwide currently live in cities that fail to meet
 international standards for air quality.  “This study provides us with
 additional insight into the chemistry of urban ozone production,” said
 Amitabha Sinha, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC San
 Diego who headed the research team. “It shows us that the chemistry of
 urban ozone is even more complicated than we initially assumed. With
 improved knowledge of how ozone is produced, we should be in a better
 position to control the air quality of large urban areas across the
 United States as well as around the world.” Urban ozone levels peak in
 the afternoon hours of large cities after being generated through a
 complex series of chemical reactions involving the interaction of
 sunlight with hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from automobile exhaust.
 Ozone production is initiated when hydroxyl radicals, OH, are produced
 from water vapor. Atmospheric chemists had long assumed that the lion’s
 share of the OH involved in urban ozone production is generated when
 ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths less than 320 nanometers
 dissociates ambient ozone to form excited oxygen atoms, which, in turn,
 react with water vapor to produce hydroxyl radicals. These OH radicals
 subsequently attack hydrocarbons and the resulting products combine
 through a series of chemical reactions with nitric oxide, NO, to
 produce nitrogen dioxide, NO2, and eventually ozone, O3.  Sinha’s team
 found in laboratory experiments that another chemical reaction also
 plays a significant role in urban OH radical production — perhaps
 comparable to that from the reaction of excited oxygen atoms with water
 vapor under certain conditions. This new mechanism involves reactions
 between water vapor and NO2 in electronically “excited states,”
 produced when NO2 absorbs visible light between the wavelengths of 450
 to 650 nanometers.  German scientists first proposed this method of
 producing OH radicals in 1997. Their measurements, however, did not
 detect any OH radicals being formed and, as a result, they suggested
 that the reaction would play a fairly insignificant role in the
 atmosphere.  The more recent measurements by the UC San Diego team
 suggest that this method of OH radical production occurs at a rate that
 is ten times faster than previously estimated. And because radiation in
 the 450 to 650 nanometers wavelength range is not filtered out as
 effectively in the lowest portion of the atmosphere as the ultraviolet
 radiation in the vicinity of 320 nanometers that generate OH radicals
 from water vapor and ozone, Sinha and other atmospheric scientists
 believe it’s likely to have a major role in the formation of smog.
 “Identifying the sources of atmospheric OH radical production is
 important to understanding how to control the ozone problem, since it
 is the reaction of OH radicals with hydrocarbons that ultimately leads
 to urban ozone,” Sinha said. “The chemistry of urban ozone production
 is complicated and it just got bit more complicated with the addition
 of this new source of OH radicals.” Sinha’s team — which included
 postdoctoral fellow Shuping Li and graduate student Jamie Matthews —
 was able to make the most precise measurement to date of the rate of
 this reaction with an innovative laser technique that allowed the team
 to directly monitor the OH radicals with significantly higher
 sensitivity then previously used to study this reaction.  “It’s a
 relatively slow reaction with a rate that is at least a thousand times
 slower than that for producing OH from the reaction of excited oxygen
 atoms with water molecules,” said Sinha. “However, there is a lot of
 solar radiation coming down over the visible wavelength region, so even
 a slow reaction can become important. The upshot is that atmospheric
 models have ignored this reaction altogether, assuming that because
 nothing can be seen using conventional techniques, nothing must be
 happening.” [Kim McDonald @ University of California — San Diego]

 Black carbon, a form of particulate air pollution most often produced
 from biomass burning, cooking with solid fuels and diesel exhaust, has
 a warming effect in the atmosphere three to four times greater than
 prevailing estimates, according to scientists in an upcoming review
 article in the journal Nature Geoscience.  Scripps Institution of
 Oceanography at UC San Diego atmospheric scientist V. Ramanathan and
 University of Iowa chemical engineer Greg Carmichael, said that soot
 and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the
 current global warming effect of carbon dioxide, more than that of any
 greenhouse gas besides CO2. The researchers also noted, however, that
 mitigation would have immediate societal benefits in addition to the
 long term effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The article,
 “Global and regional climate changes due to black carbon,” will be
 posted in the online version of Nature Geoscience on Sunday, March 23.
 “Observationally based studies such as ours are converging on the same
 large magnitude of black carbon heating as modeling studies from
 Stanford, Caltech and NASA,” said Ramanathan. “We now have to examine
 if black carbon is also having a large role in the retreat of arctic
 sea ice and Himalayan glaciers as suggested by recent studies.” In the
 paper, Ramanathan and Carmichael integrated observed data from
 satellites, aircraft and surface instruments about the warming effect
 of black carbon and found that its forcing, or warming effect in the
 atmosphere, is about 0.9 watts per meter squared. That compares to
 estimates of between 0.2 watts per meter squared and 0.4 watts per
 meter squared that were agreed upon as a consensus estimate in a report
 released last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
 (IPCC), a U.N.-sponsored agency that periodically synthesizes the body
 of climate change research.  Ramanathan and Carmichael said the
 conservative estimates are based on widely used computer model
 simulations that do not take into account the amplification of black
 carbon’s warming effect when mixed with other aerosols such as
 sulfates. The models also do not adequately represent the full range of
 altitudes at which the warming effect occurs. The most recent
 observations, in contrast, have found significant black carbon warming
 effects at altitudes in the range of 2 kilometers (6,500 feet), levels
 at which black carbon particles absorb not only sunlight but also solar
 energy reflected by clouds at lower altitudes.  Between 25 and 35
 percent of black carbon in the global atmosphere comes from China and
 India, emitted from the burning of wood and cow dung in household
 cooking and through the use of coal to heat homes. Countries in Europe
 and elsewhere that rely heavily on diesel fuel for transportation also
 contribute large amounts.  “Per capita emissions of black carbon from
 the United States and some European countries are still comparable to
 those from south Asia and east Asia,” Ramanathan said.  In south Asia,
 pollution often forms a prevalent brownish haze that has been termed
 the “atmospheric brown cloud.” Ramanathan’s previous research has
 indicated that the warming effects of this smog appear to be
 accelerating the melt of Himalayan glaciers that provide billions of
 people throughout Asia with drinking water. In addition, the inhalation
 of smoke during indoor cooking has been linked to the deaths of an
 estimated 400,000 women and children in south and east Asia.
 Elimination of black carbon, a contributor to global warming and a
 public health hazard, offers a nearly instant return on investment, the
 researchers said. Black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks
 at most compared to carbon dioxide, which remains in the atmosphere for
 more than a century. In addition, technology that could substantially
 reduce black carbon emissions already exists in the form of
 commercially available products.  Ramanathan said that an observation
 program for which he is currently seeking corporate sponsorship could
 dramatically illustrate the benefits. Known as Project Surya, the
 proposed venture would provide some 20,000 rural Indian households with
 smoke-free cookers and equipped to transmit data. At the same time, a
 team of researchers led by Ramanathan would observe air pollution
 levels in the region to measure the effect of the cookers.  Carmichael
 said he hopes that the paper’s presentation of the immediacy of the
 benefits will make it easier to generate political and regulatory
 momentum toward reduction of black carbon emissions.  “It offers a
 chance to get better traction for implementing strategies for reducing
 black carbon,” he said.  The National Science Foundation, the National
 Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Aeronautics
 and Space Administration funded the review.  [Rob Monroe, Mario

 Microsoft made a mistake with its investment in Facebook. Just because
 Google has made a business out of Internet advertising doesn’t mean
 that a traditional software company is going to do well here, too.
 Facebook is likely to be seen as Microsoft’s ace in the Web 2.0 Wars.
 Google gave birth to the “online OS” by providing many of the
 applications you might expect to find in installable form. Today,
 others, such as Facebook, are growing exponentially because they offer
 much more than just “another social medium.” Yet as great as the little
 widget-like applications that everyone is going nuts over at Facebook
 are, at its core, Facebook can and will become yesterday’s news
 someday. Here’s why:

Pull the plug. Seriously, just pull the plug on the connectivity to that
platform and watch all of that Web 2.0 nonsense deflate right before
your eyes. Whether it be a localized issue with being able to connect to
any specific portal/service/ or worse, an international hiccup in the
world’s ability to connect to the Web 2.0 company. It could happen…

Besides eyeballs, what is the real value that Facebook is providing?
Exactly, it’s a roundabout way to reach ad dollars. At the end of the
day, Facebook joining Microsoft’s own portfolio will be great for
Facebook but it’ll do very little for a company like Microsoft. Why?
Microsoft is the new IBM as Facebook is the new Yahoo! (1990s era).
Microsoft knows enterprise, but it has seriously lost its traction with
most home users in almost every sense of the word. This is just a fact;
people have been burned badly with high MS Office prices and Vista
incompatibilities. Microsoft needs to focus on one business at a time as
far as I’m concerned.

Microsoft needs to understand that the way it develops software is
dying. This doesn’t mean Microsoft will cease to exist in the near
future, but the closed source mindset with mobile OS is taking its last
breath. Same goes with Facebook. As a trend, sure, it’s cool. Yet to
dump millions into it is just plain reaching for the stars and proof of
a stale Redmond development scene.

This morning I got my mytreo.net Newsletter and despite the fact that
the page anchors don’t work in Gmail, I read (skimmed) the first
paragraph and decided to try the service they were promoting, Jott.
 The link in the email took me to a Palm page with a longer article that
 I didn’t actually read and no quick and easy way to get to what ever
 Jott was going to make me do to use it (sign up or download whatever).
 A quick Google search and I was on Jott’s website, cleverly called
 jott.com
Set up was easy, nothing to download. First and last name, email,
password, and telephone number. Then a confirmation email, then you are
asked to place a call to a 866 number to set up your phone.
 With the email and phone confirmed, an automated lady voice at the
 other end of the phone asks you to make your first Jott, which unless
 you have already added contact thru the web interface is to yourself.
 In true geek fashion, she recommends sending yourself “Hello world”.
 Original. I spoke into my phone, sent my self a message, easily set up
 a reminder (which texted and emailed me at a set time). So far so good.
 This could actually be useful.  Read more…




 Filed under: misc hacks  Our own [Eliot] dug this one up from the
 grave. While the recipe has been online for a while, do you know many
 10 year olds who made their own Aerogel, that wonderful insulator
 that's essentially gelled air? [William] made some(cache) for his
 science project in 2002. He started with Silbond H5, a combination of
 ethyl alcohol and ethyl polysilicate. You can get the MSDS after a
 painless email registration on the Silbond website. After the gel is
 formed you have to soak it in an alcohol bath to make sure all water
 has been removed from the structure. Then the gel is placed in a drying
 chamber. Liquid CO2 is forced into the chamber to displace all the
 alcohol in the chamber and the structure. Once the the alcohol is gone
 the supercritical drying phase begins. The temperature is raised to
 90degF and the pressure is regulated to 1050psi. At this point the
 liquid CO2 in the gel structure takes on gas properties (looses surface
 tension) and leaves the silica structure. All that remains in the
 chamber is your new Aerogel which is 99% empty space and 1000 times
 less dense than glass.  Of course, if you're lazy, you can buy some
 here.Read | Permalink | Email this | Linking Blogs | Comments


 Yesterday my coworkers redecorated my office.  Pictures
in this blog entry are photos of their work.  Strangely enough, I found
myself quite appreciative of their act of vandalism.  :-)

 Today is my 40th birthday.  Like most other days,
I started by walking the dog and making a To-Do list.  However, today's
list has a special item:


 Decide whether to have a mid-life crisis or not.


 :-)

 I'll confess I am not entirely thrilled about being 40.  It
doesn't seem that long ago that 40 seemed far away.  Now that it's here,
I realize that it's not what I expected.  I thought my life at 40 would
be different.

 Many who know me would assert that I have nothing to
complain about.  And they would be correct.  My life has been filled
with blessings of all kinds, for which I am truly thankful.  I am a
published author.  Most would consider me financially successful.  I am
in a career where I enjoy my work.

 But still...

 As the old saying goes, nobody lies on their deathbed
wishing they had spent more time at the office.

 Like most everybody else, when I was 30 I looked ahead ten
years and formed a picture in my mind.  My life today doesn't match that
picture very well.  Examples:


 I thought by now I would be more solid in the quality of
     my relationships with my loved ones and in the practice of my
     faith.


 I thought by now I would be a better guitar player.


 There's a messy pile in my study that has been there for
     ten years.  (Yes, we moved six years ago.  The heap moved too.)  I
     thought it would be cleaned up by now.


 I always assumed that by 40 I would have learned to
     exercise regularly and stop eating junk food.


 I go could on.  And on.  But you get the idea.

 I am tempted to think about my regrets, the places where I
took a wrong turn, the places where I would have made a smarter choice
if I knew then what I know now.

 But this whole line of thinking doesn't seem at all
conducive to good mental health, so today I will choose to focus on two
things which seem more constructive:

1.  Tapestry

 One of my favorite Star Trek episodes is called Tapestry. 
It is the story of someone given a chance to re-live a pivotal moment in
his youth so that he can avoid making the unwise choice he made the
first time.  But it turns out that his reckless moment was a critical
ingredient in his later successes.

 Today I remind myself that there are no do-overs, and I'm
not sure I would want one anyway.  For every mistake I have made, there
were negative consequences and positive lessons.  I can't expect to
avoid the former and keep the latter.  They come together as an
inseparable package.

2.  Life Calculus.

 Back in 2003 I wrote an article called Career Calculus.  In a
nutshell, it says that at any given moment in your career, what you know
is far less important than whether you are learning.

 Today I remind myself that the same principle applies in
life.  I am confident in my first derivative.  Whatever I am today, I
think I will be a better person tomorrow.

 So if I'm still blogging when I'm 50, I expect I will be
able to report progress on some of the items mentioned above.

 And just to be clear, if that heap of junk on the floor of
my study is still there, it will be larger than it is now, and I plan to
report that as progress.  :-)








 People want to be understood.  That's why support groups are
so popular.


 The alcoholic wants to connect with somebody else who showed
     up drunk at a wedding and embarrassed the bride.


 The compulsive overeater wants to know that he's not the
     only one who has stopped at the Dunkin Donuts drive-thru on the way
     home to eat a dozen before dinner.


 The out-of-control gambler wants to be in community with
     other people who have lost their car going "all in" with pocket
     sevens.


 We all have problems, and we all want to know that we're not
alone.

 Wednesday evening I posted a comment on a friend's blog.  Or rather, I
 tried
to post a comment.

 True to my tendencies, it was really far too wordy to be
called a comment.  I actually spent about half an hour wordsmithing a
multiple-paragraph response.

 But when I hit the submit button to post it, Wordpress gave
me a generic error page.  Presumably something timed out while I was
crafting my reply.

 And when I hit the Back button, my comment was gone.  :-(

 *&%$#@!

 My mind raced.  What are my options here?

 Maybe I should just re-type the whole thing?  It was only
300 words or so.

 Nah.  The text I wrote was perfect.  I probably won't be
able to remember it just the way it was.

 And why should I have to?  Firefox and Wordpress screwed
this up, not me!

 Cautiously I hit the Forward button in my browser.  Firefox
showed me this dialog:



 Aha!  I clicked OK.  Wordpress coughed up the same hairball
I got before.

 But now I know that Firefox still has my comment in memory
somewhere.  All I have to do is figure out how to get it.

 Two hours later I finally got my comment posted,
deliberately ignoring the fact that I could have retyped it ten times by
then.

 After several other attempts that brought me to dead ends,
here is the technique that succeeded:


 I installed winpcap
     and a packet sniffer, which I configured to capture all packets on
     my network interface.


 Then I went back to my still-open instance of Firefox and
     hit Reload.  I clicked the OK button in the dialog box above and
     Wordpress barfed again.


 Then I went back to the packet sniffer and found the TCP
     connection containing my posted comment.


 Ack!  I had completely forgotten that the format would be
 application/x-www-form-urlencoded. 
     Luckily, I memorized all of the punctuation marks in the ASCII
     table back when I was in middle school.  %22 would be 34 in
     decimal, so that's a quotation mark.  After several
     search-and-replace operations, all the escaped characters were
     fixed.


 During all this, I noticed and fixed a couple of typos I
     had previously missed.


 Finally I went back to my friend's blog, pasted my comment
     into the textbox and hit submit.


 Let me know that I'm not alone.  Tell me the story of
something geeky that you did.








Two interesting pieces from Exit Art gallery's BRAINWAVE: Common Senses
show -Alvin is a cellular automaton. Eight different cells produce
sound. The sound one cell produces is determined by what sound the other
cells are making. This kind of interrelated input and output scheme is
an artificial neural network; a simulation of a brain. Alvin imitates
living organisms in another way, because the sound circuits are actually
built and destroyed by one another, rather than just turned on or off.
The sound jiggles metal powder just like heat jiggles chemicals in a
living cell. It is a way of making dynamic order out of randomness.




Swarm is an autonomous roaming device whose movements are determined by
houseflies housed inside the device itself. The chamber where they live
contains food, water and light to keep them warm but also sensors that
detect the changing light patterns produced by their movements. The
sensors send the light data to an on-board microcontroller, which in
turn activate the motors moving the device in relation to the movements
of the flies.[via]

 Asking for feedback is in.

 Virtually every journalist solicits feedback by posting their email
 addresses. Some even ask overtly.

 As Forrester's Jeremiah Owyang recently noted, companies are inviting
 comments - yet far more slowly. Notably, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer
 invited everyone at Mix 08 to email him directly. (Microsoft is an
 Edelman client.)

 So what about for advertisers?

 Advertising is not exactly known as a two-way paradigm. However, the
 web changes that. Digital creative can and should be able to not only
 solicit feedback but to adjust in real-time like mood rings to what
 people say back.

 CNET and AOL Networks both invite consumers to give feedback on their
 banner ads. Above is one from American Express I found on AOL's site.
 The surveys ask respondents to rate ads for relevancy, emotive content
 and ability to move the user to purchase. However, that's as far as
 they go. The scant data I assume they collect somehow goes back to the
 advertiser.

 Weblogs Inc. - before it was owned by AOL - took an even bolder
 approach with their Focus Ads. They allowed advertisers to solicit
 reader comments on ads. However, the program seems to have been
 abandoned.

 There's a lot of room for innovation here. Advertisers can and should
 be opening themselves up for input. Further, the media companies should
 help them do so. Will they? I would be surprised to see it happens.
 Advertising is the last safe haven for one-way communication. Marketers
 won't rock the boat. Plus, it has a place in an emerging mix of
 strategies.

More news from Toy Fair 2008!

The latest tech, toy, and video game news, as always


 Music by Kevin McLeod


Rupert Murdoch and Billy Bragg: you have to wonder how these guys got in
bed in the first place. It's a notion that'll induce Scanners-esque head
explosions and I wouldn't spend much more time it, as the avowed
socialist Bragg has taken his toothbrush and, we presume, did not let
the door hit him on the way out of avowed capitalist Murdoch's crib.
Irked by terms of service that apparently gave MySpace "a non-exclusive,
fully-paid and royalty-free, worldwide license (with the right to
sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy,
modify, adapt, translate, publicly perform, publicly display, store,
reproduce, transmit, and distribute" his music, British songwriter Billy
Bragg pulled his music from the social networking site.    Bragg's
MySpace.com page offers this explanation: "SORRY THERE'S NO MUSIC,"
because "once an artist posts up any content (including songs), it then
belongs to My Space (AKA Rupert Murdoch) and they can do what they want
with it, throughout the world without paying the artist."  As Publishing
2.0 notes, the falling out is a harsh reminder of the lengths MySpace
will go to compensate for not owning any of the content (read: the
underlying value upon which much of the enterprise depends) posted on
its sites and of MySpace's still-showing Web 1.0 roots.  Naturally,
MySpace chalks this all up to a bit of sloppy lawyering.  "Because the
legalese has caused some confusion, we are at work revising it to make
it very clear that MySpace is not seeking a license to do anything with
an artist's work other than allow it to be shared in the manner the
artist intends," Berman says. "Obviously, we don't own their music or do
anything with it that they don't want."  Whew. Well, I'm relieved; how
about you? As we all know, when someone dismisses the tiny print in a
contract as "legalese," that part is immediately invalidated, right?

 We did our first show today, after three takes, it was a bit of a
 burnout, but we're rolling now. Now I have to get the RSS 2.0 feed
 configured, even though Manila doesn't have direct support for
 enclosures. (Postscript: Got it done. Now I have to do the user
 interface, but the backend part works. Jake let me know if you want the
 code.) The first day got an email from a fan saying that Dave knows his
 tech stuff, but he hopes I won't say the same things about President
 George W Bush on Trade Secrets that I say on Scripting News. I
 responded with a disclaimer, you don't want to listen to this if you're
 voting for President W. Or, if you're smart, you should listen to it.
 Never hurts to get another point of view. But we're not nice guys, or
 overly sensitive to the feelings of Republicans. "> Okay so Kerry
 changes his mind. We'll work on that after he's elected. Bush is much
 worse. He does crazy illogical and super-dangerous things. He should
 change his mind, the problem is he doesn't.  Anyway, we think Bush will
 make a great former President and look forward to throwing a great
 going-away party for him on November 3. 

		 Back in 2004, John Battelle blogged about the idea of
		 Sell Side Advertising. I thought it was a good idea and
		 blogged about it also. The idea was for the publishers
		 to choose the ads that show up on their site rather
		 than the advertisers choosing the publishers. Since
		 then, I think several people haved tried to build
		 things like it, but I haven't seen something that's
		 working well with this theory. (If you know a good
		 example let me know!)

 In 2006, we (Digital Garage) set up CGM Marketing to work with
 Technorati Japan to help explain to advertisers about advertising on
 user generated content and act as an ad rep company for Technorati and
 other user generated media sites.

 Later that year, CGMM, Digital Garage, Reid Hoffman and I invested in
 Etology, an ad marketplace company. CGMM, Techonrati Japan, the DG team
 and I worked on brainstorming what a blog ad network would look like
 and I remembered some of the thinking from that discussion about sell
 side ads.

 In Septemer of last year, we launched Ad-Butterfly, which was inspired
 by the discussion about sell side ads. Six months later, we've got 5500
 bloggers who have passed our screening and have signed up and around
 3700 bloggers actually running ads. This number is continuing to grow.
 These blogs are generating approximately 100M impressions a month.
 Right now, we're still not sold out so we're running some house ads,
 but some rough estimates show, depending on the type of blog you have,
 that you should end up getting more from our service than ad sense for
 the same number of impressions, once we can sell through the inventory.
 I think the magic number in terms of scale to get more advertisers is
 around 10,000 blogs and 200M impressions and we should hit that
 sometime soon.

 Here's how it works. As a blogger, you sign up for the service and put
 our badge on your blog. As an advertiser, you search for blogs that you
 are interested in and request to advertise on their site. The
 advertiser and the blogger can opt into allowing and using a "review
 space" which allows the blogger to comment on the ad as well.

 After testing the system and talking to bloggers, advertisers and
 readers of the blogs, we've found that we have a win-win in terms of
 trust. The bloggers like that they get to choose the ads. The
 advertisers like that they are paying for space on pages of bloggers
 who like them. The readers like that the ads are either releveant or at
 least in some way endorsed by the bloggers and say they are more likely
 to trust or click the ads.

 We've been able to get large brand-named clients like NEC, Toshiba,
 NIKE, BMW, Suntory and Softbank partially because of this and at least
 at this point, they seem to be willing to pay a premium for this
 "friendly network" sort of placement compared to run of network or
 machine targeted placement.

 In addition to scaling the network, we're working on more features to
 make it easier and more interesting for all of the parties but I think
 we're off to a good start. I'll post about some new stuff we're working
 on soon.

 So... when I sit down and think about "what comes after ad sense?" I
 think this might be one of those things...

 Thanks to Martin for suggesting I should probably blog this. ;-)

 Most consumers are aware that new high definition movie players and
 discs are available, but have hesitated to buy them up until now due to
 the format war between HD-DVD and Blu-ray. However, Toshiba abandoning
 HD-DVD will open the floodgates for home theater upgrades this year.

 It is true that Blu-ray offers up to 1080p video resolution, as well as
 interactivity and more bonus features than regular DVD, but it also
 offers four next-generation audio codecs that new adopters will need to
 know about. Here’s the low down on the latest audio formats devised by
 Dolby and DTS.   Dolby and DTS created two new codecs a piece, one
 lossy and one functionally lossless – studio-master-quality audio. All
 four are capable of at least 7.1 channels of discrete audio. All of
 them are improvements over older Dolby and DTS formats.

 Dolby Digital Plus and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio are lossy formats
 that improve on their predecessors, but are not original master
 recording quality. It's important to note that they are "lossy"
 formats, which means compressed. Some of the musical information is
 lost in translation - read that as "It is NOT accurate!"

 Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio give movie watchers an experience
 only audiophiles enjoyed for years, sound quality equivalent to the
 original recording itself – lossless, flawless, perfect! I’m sure this
 will be debated by many, but considering that the pursuit of high-end
 audio has always been to reproduce the recording as accurate to the
 original as possible, it is the definition of perfection.

 Audiophiles will want to take advantage of these new, vastly superior
 audio capabilities. Currently, the Pioneer Elite BDP-95FD and the
 Panasonic DMP-BD30K are the only Blu-ray players we carry that are
 compatible with both Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. You'll want
 to specify these players for your clients who are concerned about
 getting the most from their audio entertainment system. In addition,
 you'll want to recommend an audio-video receiver that will decode these
 formats. Currently the Pioneer Elite VSX-91TXH ($849.99) is the lowest
 priced receiver we carry with this capability. However, Yamaha will be
 releasing the RX-V663 ($499.99) soon which will do the job for our
 budget-conscious customers.

 Not only do these new audio formats offer better quality sound to
 consumers, but perhaps for the first time in the history of home
 theater, everyone has a solid reason to install a 7.1 system. The new
 industry standard for movie watching is Blu-ray. The new standards for
 audio playback are capable of 7.1 discrete audio. Although most of the
 new Blu-ray titles available are mastered in 5.1, you can expect to see
 more and more new titles mastered in 7.1 as studios grab hold of the
 new technology and make the most of it for their audience. This is a
 big deal! You'll want to look at installing 7.1 systems as a rule, as
 opposed to looking at it as an after thought.     Now is the time to
 look seriously at upgrading your home entertainment system. These major
 new capabilities will fundamentally change the way we experience
 movies. Anyone who doesn't have the latest, compatible devices in their
 home theater arsenal will be missing out on the biggest consumer
 technological revolution since the DVD itself.      


Nueva entrega de Confusión en formato largo. En estos meses de verano
con una periodicidad no tan habitual, pero con las mismas ganas y la
misma fuerza de cada entrega.  Como portada hemos elegido un grupo
mítico que con tan sólo un trabajo homónimo se hizo acreedor de los
mejores elogios a mediados de los años 90. Tuvieron que pasar casi 8
años para que Sweetback nos regalara un segundo y excepcional álbum
llamado Stage 2.  Quizás con este nombre no los hayas escuchado, pero te
aseguro que los has oído en múltiples ocasiones e incluso que su música
te ha encantado. Son los músicos que acompañan a Sade Adu.  La historia
se remonta a principios de los años 90 cuando Sade en la cima de su
carrera sufrió una depresión aguda y se mantuvo varios años sin
deleitarnos con su música. El resto de la formación que la acompañaba
decidió grabar un trabajo con ese toque mágico al que nos tenían
acostumbrados y de ahí salío esta joya de la música. En esta ocasión te
dejamos con la portada de su segundo trabajo, aunque durante el podcast
también te propondremos algunos de los temazos de su primer álbum.   La
Frase: Con las piedras que con duro intento los críticos te lanzan, bien
puedes erigirte un monumento. (Inmanuel Kant 1724-1804)    Cumpleaños y
obituario del día.  Como siempre en las ediciones en formato largo
tenemos mitología, cumpleaños y obituario, tecnología y utilidades para
blogs y podcast y por supuesto el plato fuerte con las noticias locas
con J. R. Mora  ¿Y Ramón? ¿Y la vecina? Tendrás que escucharlo para
saber qué ocurrió.  Durante el programa hemos emitido las promos del
Podcast Esquiva Esto, del Podcast de Fórmula 1 y del Podcast Pataca
Minuta.   Hemos programado música de   Sweetback, DePhazz, Broklyn Funk
Essentials y Maysa   Puedes descargarlo o escucharlo directamente AQUÍ
en este mini-reproductor. También puedes escucharlo en cualquiera de los
reproductores de la derecha o usar un reproductor externo en los que
tendras que incluir esta dirección RSS.   Te recomiendo Ziepod o Itunes,
aunque también tienes reproductores en Yahoo, Google, Odeo, Podnova,
Podcast.net, Podcast Alley, Idiotvox, Podfeed y muchos más.
Sobrepasamos las 100 entregas con esta edición del podcast Confusión en
Radio Esperantia y seguimos con un formato musical que en este caso,
será el que le dé paso al formato largo, el número 102.  Como portada
hemos elegido un gran trabajo de Skip Martin, este trompetista,
vocalista y arreglista norteamericano, miembro de Dazz Band o de Kool &
the gang.  Su álbum de debut se llama Miles High y es una gozada porque
resume en todos los temas su dilatada carrera musical.  Si te fijas, con
esta edición estrenamos nuevo favicón que podrás ver junto a la
dirección de este blog. Espero y deseo que toda la música que hemos
seleccionado para tí, sea de tu agrado.  La Frase: Los seres humanos no
nacen para siempre el día en que sus madres los alumbran, sino que la
vida los obliga a parirse a sí mismos una y otra vez. (Gabriel García
Márquez 1928)  Hemos programado música de Skip Martin, Robert
Monteleone, Keith Jacobson, Llorca, Mo Horizons, Randy Muller, Nils
Landgren, Nina Simone, Philip Martin y Tower of Power  Puedes
descargarlo o escucharlo directamente AQUÍ en este mini-reproductor.
También puedes escucharlo en cualquiera de los reproductores de la
derecha o usar un reproductor externo en los que tendras que incluir
esta dirección RSS.   Te recomiendo Ziepod o Itunes, aunque también
puedes encontrar reproductores en Google, Odeo, Podnova, Podcast.net,
Podcast Alley, Idiotvox, Triyo, Digg, Podfeed y muchos más.  Continuamos
con un podcast en formato largo con todo el contenido habitual:
Mitología, tecnología, noticias locas, literatura, etc y llegamos ya al
número 102.  Una vez más agradecer a todos los que siguen Confusión, lo
escuchan y forman parte de ésta, cada vez más gran familia.  Para
ilustrar esta edición hemos elegido un disco que en realidad son dos o
dos discos que es uno sólo. Se trata de In the light/In the Night del
multiinstrumentista francés Shazz.  In the light es más jazzero e In the
night es más lounge. En ambos casos la calidad está asegurada. Detrás
puedes escuchar trompetas, flautas, cellos, violines y lo típico en
estas formaciones: teclados, bajos y guitarras. A mi me sorprendió
gratamente descubrir a Shazz, un señor que ha colaborado con gente como
Ludovique Navarre aka St. Germain. Espero que lo disfrutes al igual que
con el resto de la música que te hemos seleccionado para la edición de
este número.  La Frase: La imaginación consuela a los hombres de lo que
no pueden ser. El humor los consuela de lo que son. (Winston Churchill
1874 - 1965)  Como siempre en las ediciones en formato largo tenemos
mitología, cumpleaños y obituario, tecnología y utilidades para blogs y
podcast (Cómo crear un favicón en un minuto) y las noticias locas con J.
R. Mora  Podcast recomendado: El podcast de Luis Castilla, desde México.
Inmigración, calentamiento global y temas sociales entre otros
contenidos interesantes.  Hemos programado música de Shazz, Rayford
Griffin, Mavis Staples, 3rd Force, Korsakow, Rae & Christian feat Bobby
Womack y Sweet Coffe & Hed Kandi   Puedes descargarlo o escucharlo
directamente AQUÍ en este mini-reproductor. También puedes escucharlo en
cualquiera de los reproductores de la derecha o usar un reproductor
externo en los que tendras que incluir esta dirección RSS.   Te
recomiendo Ziepod o Itunes, aunque también puedes encontrar
reproductores en Google, Odeo, Podnova, Podcast.net, Podcast Alley,
Idiotvox, Triyo, Digg, Podfeed y muchos más.  After the XPS M1330 and
XPS M1730, Dell has brought out the XPS M1530 to expand it's XPS range.
The Dell XPS M1530 maintains the same metallic finish and stylish
chassis that made the M1330 so adorable. The system is optimal for
workaholics who bind themselves to their work place and for home theater
fanatics who fancy things like luxury hardware.  The M1530 can be
considered as a desktop replacement while still being light enough for
short trips at 6.2 pounds—and that's with a nine-cell, 85-Wh battery.
With a standard six-cell battery reducing the system's weight to 5.9
pounds, it becomes less of a burden. The XPS M1530 is sleek and is
available in three colors: Tuxedo Black, Alpine White, and Crimson Red.
Unlike the XPS M1330, the M1530 doesn't provide you with an option for
an LED screen. (LED options will be available early this year). The
benefits of LEDs include slimmer profiles and long-lived battery life.
The fluorescent lighting in the M1530's screen adds to the overall
thickness of the system; it doesn't, however, take anything away from
its brightness or quality of the viewing experience. It offers you a
resolution of 1,440-by-900.  The M1530 is one of the first notebooks
ever to sport a slot-loading (not a tray-ejecting) Blu-ray burner. With
all the Blu-ray movies popping up lately, the 15.4-inch widescreen is
more than capable of accommodating a decent high-definition experience.
This system has three USB ports and a single Firewire post. There's also
an HDMI-out port that'll let you run a cable over to a larger display,
so you can view your Blu-ray content n your big-screen HDTV. You'll need
to purchase a separate HDMI cable, though. The 2-megapixel webcam grants
you good face time with friends and family.  The M1530's energy
swallowing levels won't earn it an Energy Star sticker in the near time,
but the system's raw horsepower seems to be quite notable. This notebook
comes with an Intel Core 2 Duo T7500 (2.2 GHz) processor and 2GB of RAM.
The XPS M1530 loads Windows Vista Home Premium.  Undifferentiated from
the M1330, the M1530 loads discrete graphics for high-definition
enthusiasts who are also part-time gamers. The bundled nVidia GeForce
8600M GT is a tier higher than the nVidia GeForce 8400M GS found on the
XPS M1330. Both sets have nVidia's PureVideo engine, which offers
hardware decoding for high-definition playback and cranks up frame rates
when playing the latest 3D games.  Priced at $2,174, the Dell XPS M1530
is the newcomer in the XPS series, featuring a 15.4-inch widescreen,
awesome performance scores, and one of the first ever slot-loading
Blu-ray burners. It's design elements and raw horsepower make it a great
choice for guys who are seeking to replace their desktops.

It's crunch time, yet again, for Sprint's troubled next-generation
wireless network -- and the unlikely collection of on-again, off-again
partnerships the company needs to get the technology off the ground.

Google and the nation's two biggest cable TV companies are among the
investors finalizing negotiations to provide up to $2.5 billion for
Sprint and a smaller wireless provider named Clearwire to build the
nationwide network, according to a source close to the talks. "The deal
is about 90 percent done," but could fall apart at the last minute
before a planned Apr. 1 announcement, this person says.

The proposed alliance with Comcast, Time Warner, and a smaller provider
called Brighthouse Networks would revive the cable industry's soured
relationship with Sprint, whose financial travails have forced it to
find more backing for the new network based on a Wi-Fi relative called
WiMax. It would also finally bring to fruition a lengthy dalliance
between Sprint and Clearwire that seemed to unravel late last year.

What binds these bedfellows? One motivation is their common interest in
forging a bulwark against the biggest and most formidable telecom
service providers, ATT and Verizon.  <p> <subhead> Joining Forces?
</subhead> <p> Under the proposed deal, Sprint would spin off its
Xohm-branded WiMax business and merge it with Clearwire to create what
they hope will be the first company to deliver so-called 4G, or
fourth-generation, speeds to mobile devices across the U.S. Sprint and
Clearwire have been exploring ways to join forces for such a venture for
two years, with the possibilities ranging from simple roaming agreements
to a full-fledged merger of WiMax efforts. But to date they haven't been
able to agree on funding or management for the $5 billion project.  <p>
Indeed, it still wasn't immediately clear whether a Sprint or Clearwire
executive would take the lead in Xohm's operations, nor where the new
company would be...

 The first thing I thought of was the Tablet PC when I saw Sketchcast as
 a delicious popular post in my RSS reader this morning. With Sketchcast
 you can share drawings with or without voice all through a pen-friendly
 Flash interface in the browser (Firefox or IE). I made a mockup of
 Hmmcast #174 entirely using Sketchcast. Unfortunately it’s not
 available in HD or as a download so I don’t think this will be the
 ‘official’ Hmmcast #174, which is one disappointing aspect of
 Sketchcast. Accordingly, not releasing this at the 4:20 publish time.
 Here’s what my very first effort — complete with a few errors — looks
 like (if you can’t see the object embed in your reader, clickthru on
 this post to view from the website):



 The Sketchcast fine print
Also, it’s only for personal use licensing unless written permission
from Sketchcast is obtained per the Sketchcast Terms of Service: (v) You
agree not to use the Website for any commercial use, without the prior
written authorization of Sketchcast;
 Delving deeper into the Sketchcast TOS we learn what rights you give up
 with anything produced using Sketchcast:
For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User
Submissions. However, by submitting User Submissions to Sketchcast, you
hereby grant Sketchcast a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute,
prepare derivative works of, and display the User Submissions in
connection with the Website and any of Sketchcast’s, and its successors,
assigns and affiliates, business and operations, including without
limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Website
(and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any
media channels.
 So basically, Sketchcast can take your work, no matter how long you’ve
 worked on it, and use it to promote Sketchcast without any additional
 permission needed from you, the publisher. This isn’t too unusual in
 the video world these days (publishers, check your favorite video site
 for similar language). The licensing goes further though, allowing
 anybody to remix and mash anything you publish through Sketchcast: You
 also hereby grant each user of the Website a non-exclusive license to
 access your User Submissions through the Website, and to use,
 reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Submissions as
 permitted through the functionality of the Website and under these
 Terms and Conditions. The above licenses granted by you in User
 Submissions are perpetual and irrevocable.  Not terribly useful for
 groups desiring privacy
It’s too bad Sketchcast couldn’t allow publishers to choose the
licensing of their choice. I’m curious if more fun type sketches and
less serious ones will fill the site? Looking around at what’s there so
far, it’s a mixed bag. In general, I like it, and it could be useful for
quickly sharing ideas — just not very private ideas, unfortunately —
with others. If they add a private groups feature, it would be handy for
sharing sketches with project ideas that groups aren’t ready to share
with the whole world. Then again, I think there are a few whiteboard
apps out there for other programs.
 Haven’t written about my Tablet PC experiences as much in the third
 year of ownership and recently passed the 1,000 day mark as being a
 Table PC owner. However, it was nice this morning to see an online
 application where the Tablet PC shines — in Firefox too, another rarity
 of sorts.

 Got my exercise in for the month opening the anti-theft packaging for
 Nintendo Wii Super Mario Galaxy.

 Watch Hmmcast

 Hmmcast #179 downloads Windows .wmv (1480×1080 HD)  PSP .mp4 (480×272)
 iPod .mp4 (640×480) How does Super Mario Galaxy look with component
 video cable on HDTV?
A friend asked me to check out how Super Mario Galaxy looks on an HDTV
with a component cable connection to the Wii. In one word: TERRIBLE.
Maybe I have something set wrong, but here’s the setup:
 - React component cable for the Wii
- 40″ Samsung LCD HDTV - Nintendo Wii + Super Mario Galaxy
 I’ll shoot some comparative video of other Nintendo Wii titles and then
 compare to Super Mario Galaxy in a future Hmmcast. I don’t think I’ve
 ever complained about graphics in a popular title, but I’m very
 disappointed in what I’m seeing. At worst it’s like looking at an
 overcompressed JPEG, at best, it’s still noticeable.  I doublechecked
 in the Wii options that the TV Resolution was set to 480p (it’s worse
 at the default 480i, naturally) and it’s not nearly as sharp. Maybe I
 should have left it on the old analog TV. The Wii stuff looks good on
 there. Or maybe I’m spoiled by the 720p and 1080p PS3 and Xbox 360
 titles.

many useful features that make it one of the best music managers out
there.  Even better is that both mac and PC users can take advantage of
it's feature set.  One of the hidden utilities in iTunes is the ability
to view duplicate files.  The reason you may want to do this is if you
have CD's from one artist that perhaps has the same song on both.
Duplicate songs take up extra space and also can throw off any smart
playlists you have if you're constantly alternating between which
version you're listening to.  To view all duplicate files, click View,
Show Duplicates.  At this point your library will only show the
duplicate files.  You can now go through the files and delete anything
you have that isn't needed.  It's recommended to listen to the tracks
first, just to be sure you're not removing a song that has a live
version or an alternate version you like.  Some songs can be named the
same thing but sound different when listening.  By going through this
area, you free up space and keep your library neat and organized.

 There are many server monitoring services out there, but not many have
 ways for you to easily take in and read that information on your own.
 One of the few that do is WebSitePulse.  They provide a Firefox addon
 that will give you a brain dead simple way of keeping a watchful eye
 over your own domains.  Here is a little more about the extension from
 the developers: The WebSitePulse Current Status extension provides an
 easy way to keep an eye in real-time on the status of your servers,
 websites and web applications when you are using the WebSitePulse
 monitoring service.
  The WebSitePulse extension is broken off into two components.  The
  sidebar will display all targets and their current status.  To get
  more details, all you have to do is click on the name of the target in
  question.
 At the bottom it will also give you a counter telling you when was the
 last time it was refreshed.  The second component would be the status
 bar icon which indicates if everything is alright.  Here you pretty
 much play red light, green light.  Red is bad and green, well… green is
 good.  You can then right click the status bar icon to customize the
 extension’s settings.  You will need to also login to WebSitePulse.com
 and create a free account to use this tool.  This current status addon
 for Firefox does a good job at doing real time status tracking.  If you
 are interested in keeping a watchful eye over your server, it might be
 worth checking out.

In Episode 19, The talk of two Malcolms, Malcolm Gladwell spoke of the
genius of Howard Moskowitz and his ability to fundamentally grasp the
nature of consumer taste. In this episode we continue the thread of
Product Design and Consumer Behavior with an interview with Howard. How
do companies figure out what consumers want? For example, when you look
at all the different types of spaghetti sauce in the grocery store, do
you wonder how the endless varieties were developed? In many cases, the
companies may have just guessed, but they also may have used methods
developed by Howard Moskowitz, an expert in the field of psychophysics,
and author of the upcoming book Selling Blue Elephants. Howard Moskowitz
is the CEO of i-Novation Inc as well as President of Moskowitz Jacobs
Inc., a firm he founded in 1981. He is both a well-known experimental
psychologist in the field of psychophysics and an inventor of
world-class market research technology. We also reach back into the
archives for a 1954 General Motors Chevrolet sponsored short film
entitled "What Mr Bell had in mind". This features DON AMECHE recreating
his famous movie role as Alexander Graham Bell. Mr Bell discusses proper
telephone etiquette.The music features Robin Tymm and "Telephone Line"

 SharePointCommunity, MOSS 2007, SharePoint2007 Here’s a dandy gadget
 for car lovers and owners. Whenever I get a flat car battery, I just
 call the local car workshop guys to come over with a new one. Sure I
 can get messy, pop open the front and get the old one out but that’s a
 messy thing to do. You can now buy a $20 thingy like the Porta Jump and
 start up your car without the mess. This gadget gets plugged into your
 cigarette lighter and with the green light lighted up, you are good to
 go. You don’t even need jumper cables or call the garage. Nice. I wish
 they shipped it internationally.  Deliver power to your vehicle’s
 battery through the cigarette lighter or power port. In 10 minutes or
 less, from the convenience and safety of your vehicle, you can be back
 on the road. No waiting for the motor club, roadside assistance or,
 worse yet, having to leave your vehicle in bad weather or a dangerous
 area. Rechargeable, too—re-charges itself as you drive! So it never
 leaves your vehicle. It’s always ready whenever and wherever you need
 it.  via jcwhitney and gizmonews Share This

 Canada’s public broadcaster, CBC Television, will be using bit-torrent
 to distribute its popular Canada’s Next Great Prime Minister after it
 airs on terrestrial broadcast (Sunday night at 7:00 p.m.) The CBC has
 dabbled in bit-torrent before — the now-cancelled late-night arts show
 ZeD torrented its final episode a few years back — but the show’s crew
 believes this will mark the first time a major broadcaster in North
 America provides a DRM-free torrent of a prime-time program.  This
 year’s show really began online. CBC was the first Canadian broadcaster
 to use YouTube to cast the show where our results were:

 144 people auditioned 500+ videos (video responses made this the
 largest online political debate in Canadian history) 270,000+ views
 2500 comments

 Facebook was big too with over 7500 members joining 50 groups about the
 show. We also created a dozen behind-the-scenes Podcasts showcasing our
 10 semi-finalists who were hand picked from our YouTube search.

This is an article from Tod Maffin, a social media strategist, national
broadcaster, and leading keynote speaker.

 Disclosure: This is a review of the Blackberry Pearl, distributed in
 Canada by Rogers. I was not compensated in any way for this review.
 Rogers loaned me a test unit for a couple of weeks; it has now been
 returned.  I’ve spent a few weeks in heavy testing with this handset
 and it is a great phone. It takes a while to get used to the
 two-letters-on-each-key scheme, but having a QWERTY keyboard is really
 handy.  Here are my review points.  AUDIO QUALITY
I’m impressed by the audio quality of Rogers’ network. I had no
dropouts, and the clarity was strong in all areas I tested.  It had
enough range in the top end to make the sound nice and crisp.
 OUTSIDE APPLICATIONS
This is a great phone for additional applications. The Gmail app works
like a charm, if you don’t use the Blackberry’s outstanding email
functionality. Other applications are easy to download and install and
operate flawlessly.
 INTEROPERABILITY
I had no problem importing my contacts via Bluetooth and even used this
phone as a remote control on stage in front of 2000 people.
 CAMERA
The camera is very sharp and includes a Flash. Sending the photo via
email is quick and easy — a link exists directly from the camera
application.
 PHONE SPEED
This is the only knock I have against this handset. It’s not very
speedy. Several times when I dialed a number, it “forgot” the first
number. And every so often, it would lock up. I’d get a little hourglass
icon spinning forever. It seemed to happen with the camera app and would
only recover when I took the battery out.
 BATTERY LIFE
Power consumption is excellent on this phone.
 NICE TOUCHES
The Blackberry Pearl has a nice weather application — and its icon
displays the current weather conditions in your area. So you just have
to look at the screen to see what the weather is like. Or, uh, you could
look out the window.
 All in all, this is a great handset. It sounds great on the Rogers
 network, the camera is easy to use, and it continues to provide great
 access to email. If they boost the speed a bit, this will be the
 perfect phone.

 I’ve decided I’m going to start up my reviews site again, but integrate
 it with this blog. So let’s start with where I am right now, the Delta
 Hotel Regina.  I’m not thrilled.  The room is nice, but…

They had my checkout date wrong, and it looks like I’m on my own for the
last night now The Internet connection is flaky. It won’t access Gmail,
which is my primary email service.  The in-room heater doesn’t work. At
first, it didn’t do anything. Now (after a visit from the bellman), it
makes a humming noise but barely adds any heat to the room.  The hotel
doesn’t have any space heaters available.  The clock radio was
unplugged.  The room service dinner was (a) lukewarm, and (b) not as
described in the menu. It claimed to be a chicken “stuffed with crab,
shrimp, scallops, and cheddar cheese.” Instead it was a small breast
with a few tidbits of crab and shrimp tossed into the sauce as an
afterthought. The “garlic mashed potatoes” had no garlic in them.

 On the bright side, it’s a nice room with a duvet on the bed.  <sigh>

I've been visiting Starbucks less and less and reading the NYTimes
online, so I didn't get a chance to see the Firefox double-page ad when
it appeared in the paper. So I decided to download and examine a PDF
from Mozzilla's press area.


Impressive PDF. Kills Apple's Preview (even the latest version in 10.3.7
- and I'm running a dual 2Ghz G5 with 2GB RAM!). It also didn't render
well in Adobe Photoshop.


What finally worked? Adobe's Acrobat Professional 6. Must be the zillion
or so rendered names - presumably of folks that downloaded the software.
I did, but, I couldn't find my name in the ad. Can you find yours?


If you're still running IE on you PC, you really ought to consider
switching to Firefox. For both ease-of-use and security reasons. Even on
the Mac, where we have Safari, I tend to use Firefox more. Why? Well,
for one, Safari just isn't as fast or as current when it comes to
HTML/CSS/DHTML standards. There's also an obvious lack for built-in HTML
editing. They've promised to correct that for Tiger. We'll see...

 on new year's day the into, the union representing ireland's primary
 school teachers, came out and blasted education minister mary hanafin
 for her record on investing in technology for schools. in a statement
 general secreatry john carr called for the department to publish its
 plan on how it was going to spend the €252 million earmarked in the
 national development plan for tech in schools.   “We have one of the
 lowest rates of ICT usage in education in the developed world,” said Mr
 Carr. “This is unsurprising given that one in five of all school
 computers are clapped out.”   yesterday the telecoms and internet
 federation released a statement that 98 per cent of schools now have
 broadband as a result of an €18 million initiative between industry and
 the government begun a number of years ago. in it mary hanafin talks up
 the importance of technology in education (the release is not yet
 online):   "ICT in the classroom is important, both in terms of giving
 students the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and acquire the
 necessary skills for participation in the Information Society, and in
 terms of enhancing the educational experience across the broad range of
 subjects taught in schools. The Schools Broadband Access Programme is a
 fundamental building block in ensuring that ICT usage becomes embedded
 in teaching and learning in our schools."  just coincidence these two
 press releases were issued within two weeks of each other? certainly
 many in the technology industry feel that mrs hanafin is prioritising
 special needs and school buildings at the expense of technology
 investments and they are questioning why we can't have both.

The ability to direct and transmit electrical power through the air,
without wires, took a further step from the theoretical to the practical
in June when a group of MIT researchers demonstrated their "WiTricity"
concept.   The technology works by transmitting electricity as a
magnetic field oscillating at a specific frequency.  Through
"magnetically coupled resonance," the "receiver" can capture the
electricity, making for an efficient and safe method of over-the-air
transfer.  Wireless transmission of electricity has been understood in
theory since the work of Nikolai Tesla in the 19th Century.  Safe,
efficient and cost-effective wireless electricity could hold countless
beenfits, from eliminating the need to install costly copper wiring to
lowered reliance on batteries for small devices.  However, despite the
success of WiTricity, the technology has a long way to go before it is
deployed commercially... not to mention the need to better understand
side effects such as interference and possible effects on health and the
environment.   Source:  Self Service World



 Somehow I forgot to post about this bug I found in iMovie in December.
 Basically, if you import from camera iMovie lowers the quality of the
 movie.  But if you choose “Import Movies…” it works as expected.  So I
 just got a reply from Apple (I entered it as a bug in the developer bug
 tracker).  Their reply was that my camera, a Sanyo Xacti HD700, is not
 supported.  The funny thing, is that when looking for this camera I was
 specifically looking for one that had support for Mac.  Oh well, at
 least I have an easy workaround.  Here are the details I sent Apple:
 Summary:
When I import from my Sanyo Xacti HD700 using “Import from Camera…” the
import quality has significant blocking / compression artifacts.
However, if I copy the same file off the SD card from the camera and
play it back in QTplayer it does not have this same blocking /
compression artifacts.  The file is a .MP4 container using H.264 codec
for video and AAC for audio. The resolution is 1280×720p and framerate
30fps.
 After spending a significant portion of time messing around with iMovie
 08 trying to get it to import without the quality loss I have
 discovered that “Import from Camera…” and “Import Movies…” have
 different behavior (in terms of video quality) on the SAME FILE.  Steps
 to reproduce:
1) Record a video with Sanyo Xacti HD700 camera. (One with a nice color
gradient is good because it will make the compression artifacts more
obvious).  2) Import the video from the camera using “Import from
Camera…” (Name the event “Import from Camera” so you can remember which
is which) 3) Copy the .MP4 file from the mounted drive onto your local
harddrive. (Not sure if this step is actually necessary, but haven’t
tried without) 4) Import the video from the .MP4 on your desktop using
“Import Movies…” (Name the event “Import Movies”) Notice that this
completes much quicker than step 2.  5) Find the two imported movies in
your “iMovie Events” folder. You will notice that both movies are
different sizes when you would expect them to be identical. (In my case
the movie from “Import from Camera” was 47.4MB while the movie from
“import movies” was 33.1MB, and the file on the SD card was 33.1 MB) 6)
At this point you will also notice that the movie imported from camera
will have a custom name like clip-2007-12-26 14;41;44.mov while the
movie from “import movies” will have the same filename as it did on the
camera i.e SANY0025.MP4.  7) Now open both files in QTplayer and arrange
them side by side showing the same frame. You will see that the quality
is much worse in the file from “Import from Camera”.
 Expected results:
I expect that the quality of the imported file would be identical,
regardless of whether I use “Import from camera…” or “Import Movies…”
when I am importing from the same file.
 Actual results:
The quality of the imported file is degraded when using “Import from
camera…”
 Hypothesis (i.e. the part that will make the Software Engineers laugh
 ;):
My guess is that when you select “Import from Camera” it does some
transcoding on these files that it doesn’t do when you select “Import
Movies”. (Maybe Import from Camera always transcodes, whereas Import
Movies checks to see if it needs to transcode or not?) I believe this
because it takes significantly longer using the “Import from Camera”
during which time it would appear to be performing some type of
transformation on the movie. Also, because the file name in the folder
is different.  I believe that either this transcoding is flawed or of
poor quality which leads to the poor quality video when importing.
 Work around:
Use “Import Movies…” instead of “Import from Camera…”
 Here is a thread which contains a screengrab of the two movies side by
 side in QTplayer on the same frame. The one on the left was imported
 with “Import from Camera” and the one on the right with “Import
 Movies”. Look at the right side of the yellow playset and also at the
 hair. In motion it looks quite bad.

 I’ve always been a proponent of the viewpoint that a person should be
 able to do whatever you want with things that you own.  So if I buy a
 CD, I believe that I should be able to listen to it however I want to.
 If I want to copy it off of the CD so that I can listen to it on my
 iPod I am going to do that.  If I want to convert my whole CD
 collection into MP3’s so that I can easily listen to any of them
 through my home stereo, or in my car or on my smartphone I’m going to
 do that.  And for audio there are a lot of tools that make it easy to
 use your purchases the way that you want.  However, for movies this
 hasn’t been the case.  If you wanted to take a movie that you own and
 put it on your laptop harddrive so that you can watch it on a trip you
 typically have had to jump through a lot of hoops to do this.  It
 hasn’t been convenient.  So when I came across HandBrake I was happy to
 see that someone was working on making this easy for movies.  (For
 Macintosh and BeOS)
You’ll see on the website that it’s still beta, but from some quick
tests it seems like this is on the right track.
 Maybe I’ll start thinking about creating a digital collection of my
 movies now, much like I have done with my music.

 Several listeners have reported problems downloading the program - or
 even being able to resolve the website.  I thought that I’d post the
 info, in case you or someone you know may be having problems.  Here’s
 one of the messages that outlines the difficulty: Looks like the DNS
 problem where Cox users can not access the feed or web site has
 returned.  The last episode I was able to download was on Monday
 morning, and as of this morning I have been unable to access the feed
 or web site.  However, I have been able to reach the web site from work
 (which is not on the Cox network).  Sounds like the problem from a year
 ago or so has returned.

 The last time that there were problems, it was just at the time that I
 was changing hardware at GoDaddy and got an IP address that was on a
 Cox blacklist.  I wonder if Cox made some changes, restored from an old
 backup tape and I am back on that blacklist again ?  If you are
 experiencing problems resolving the site, downloading the podcast or on
 your iTunes please let me know.  If you work for Cox or have a contact
 there, that would really help !  Thanks, Andy

If you're in business today, you've heard the phrase, "customer churn."
Customer churn is another way of saying that if the service you provide
your customers is not adequate, those customers are going to do business
with another provider. A new survey on customer churn, commissioned by
BMC Software and conducted by Research Now, gives a detailed picture of
the demographics, industries, causes, and effects of customer churn in
Europe (easily extensible to the U.S.), and guess what? It's all about
looking at service from the customer's point of view rather than from
the company's or looking from the outside in. Yet, BMC's Peter Armstrong
believes that with Business Service Management, your IT department can
help calm the customer churn, and enable your business to truly see what
your service looks like, from the customer's point of view, and do what
it takes to keep them happy. Tune in to this podcast interview to get
more insights about IT and customer service, and download the survey to
get all the details.

 Business process management (BPM) is one of the fastest-growing
 software markets but faces organizational challenges, according to a
 BEA Systems study on the BPM market.

 Completed January 25 and released this week, BEA's "The 2008 State of
 the BPM Market White Paper" drew on more than 100 analyst reports,
 articles and customer surveys, the company said in an executive summary
 of the report.

 The market is estimated to grow from $500 million in 2006 to $6 billion
 in 2011, a more than tenfold increase. Respondents, however, cited
 organizational challenges to deployment as outweighing technical
 challenges. Organizational issues included internal politics, change
 management, a dearth of skilled business analysts and lack of
 organizational alignment.

 BPM has seen rapid growth in recent years because it brings business
 analysts and technologists together with shared tools and strategies.
 Successful BPM deployments view continuous process improvement as
 imperative, BEA said. BPM is increasingly being used to manage
 processes spanning multiple packaged applications.

 BEA reported that a survey of its AquaLogic middleware customers in
 November 2007 found that 68 percent of respondents connect BPM and SOA.

 Market consolidation was noted, with the nearly 150 vendors in the BPM
 space in 2006 being reduced to just 25 in 2007.

 Leading BPM products support collaborative and social process
 activities that today are lost in email, documents and hallway
 discussions, BEA said.

 Absolument fabuleux : grâce à Vincent et Web Worker Daily, je découvre
 Freshbook, un outil pour les “free-lanceurs” et les indépendants en
 tout genre pour facturer leurs services. On dirait bien que quelqu’un a
 compris la mondialisation vue de ce côté-là. L’outil vous crée une page
 selon vos goûts, à vos couleurs et logos, et se charge de tous les
 calculs de tant-par-heure-en-dollars-font-x-euro-ou-yen pour établir
 des factures, les envoyer, négocier, réclamer, tout en gérant vos
 heures travaillée, vos collaborateurs, vos notes de frais. Ce n’est pas
 gratuit (la version d’essai l’est) mais 14$ par mois pour gérer les
 paperasses de 25 clients, c’est correct. Il existe également un service
 pour que quelqu’un se charge de poster les factures (aux USA
 uniquement, j’en ai peur) ! Peut-être que le site ne résiste pas à
 l’examen approfondi d’un vrai gérant de SARL ou de SA et n’intègre pas
 toutes les complexités de l’administration française, mais pour
 l’heure, je suis enthousiasmée. D’ailleurs, voici un lien de
 parrainage qui, si quelqu’un s’abonne, me permettra de tout faire
 gratuitement !

 The many online social media have become an important part of the
 marketing mix for many corporations and organizations. Whether it means
 listening to online conversations, participating in communities of
 enthusiasts, clients, consumers or social networks, or simply
 increasing transparency, understanding how social media can be made to
 work for you is key to building stronger brand engagement and loyalty.
 It’s also going to save you money. But how?  In this video podcast,
 Marketing Voices’ Jennifer Jones, and others, talk with industry
 insiders to find out how combining social media with the art of
 storytelling in blogs, wikis and podcasts will foster conversations,
 convert incremental audience, and ultimately increase audiences’
 engagement with brands. How can you use social media to create a voice
 for your brand that resonates beyond your corporate Web site? How can
 syndication help move your brand’s voice to your audiences, and bring
 those audiences back to your brand?  Tags: social media,  syndication,

  Enjoy ...
Thanks to all of you who participated in the Sept. 8th live event.  We
ran for 2 hours, way too long for the podcast but I've chopped it down

  Many thanks go out to Amber Mac, Mikey "Hot Stuff" Laz, Jeff, and Big
  Brian from command-N and Jenn from OpenAlpha for joining us and taking
  part in all of the fun!

  We had Jeff MacArthur from command-N on, but due to inevitable,

  will be with here in Toronto in October and he will join us for
  another live event.

  Here is my crazy attempt at show notes

  Stay tuned for the time and date of the next live techPhile podcast.

 Yahoo joins OpenSocial. MySpace SVP: "Yahoo is an important addition to
 the OpenSocial movement, and through this foundation we will work
 together to provide developers with the tools to make the Internet move
 faster and to foster more innovation and creativity." (Wired)

 Surprise! Broadcasters hate white space. NAB's Dennis Wharton: Google
 fails to show devices won't interfere with digital broadcasts. (CRN)

 11 freaking hours? Netflix's site and logistics computers went down for
 a whopping 11 hours  yesterday. The outage started at 7 am and lasted
 until 6. It took down distribution centers as well, so movies will be
 delayed a day or two. Customers are wondering if Netflix is getting too
 big for its own good. Wired)

 And now a service pack people really care about ... MSFT is getting
 closer to releasing SP3 for Windows XP. It released Release Candidate 2
 "Refresh" on Tuesday, a second crack at the RC2 first released in
 February. The final release will happen in the first half of 08, is all
 MSFT will say.

 Paris exposed ... Facebook privacy controls fail a test. A computer
 tech was able to pull up supposedly access-controlled photos, like one
 of Paris Hilton at the Emmy Awards, despite Facebook's privacy
 controls. Facebook said he had exposed a bug that was fixed
 immediately.





We are joined this week by RedIronFist as we discuss switching your
internet browser to <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Mozilla
Firefox</a>. We discuss the steps needed to switch (from download, past
install, by initial setup, to daily use). We touch on the reasons
Mozilla states to switch, and we explain our our reasons for switching.
We also discuss our favorite add ons to the browser, and some of the
drawbacks of switching away from Internet Explorer.Unfortunatly we lost
some of the audio as the connection died mid way through. So certain
bits might sound a bit funny where I connected the two sound files.<a

 A while ago I posted on Twitter, on this blog and on the Hotwire
 Facebook group that we were hiring a PR junior. We got heaps of
 applications, and with the tip that I picked it up from Jason
 'squillionaire' Calacanis (to use your social networks first when
 you're looking to hire staff) I'm posting again to say I'm looking to
 hire someone again, this time a digital PR maesto.   I'm on the hunt
 for a PR person preferably with a digital PR background, but the right
 attitude is what matters. It would be great if you've done PR for
 internet, TV, media or social media companies, but a variety of
 backgrounds would be good too. And a few years in PR agency land would
 be nice.

 If you think our gaff might be a nice place to work, please let me
 know. Even if you're just wondering. Or if you know someone I should
 have chat to!

 We're offering nice packages and nice work to keep you interested (of
 course I would say that, but it's true, honest). Have a look at our
 site or my last job post if you want to know what it is we do in case
 you're not sure. But if you read my blog then you'll have a fair idea I
 think.

 The Sunday Times says we're the best small PR firm to work for. And PR
 Week says we're doing some nice work too. And if you like things like
 flexi-hours, a very nice bunch of clients, and good coffee, let me
 know! I'm on drewbenvie @ gmail.com


  Pues como muchos sabrán, ahora mismo se esta llevando a cabo en la
  ciudad de Las Vegas,  y pues sin menor ni mayor aviso me vine para
  acá, para quienes no tienen idea de lo que es Defcon, pueden visitar
  ese link para enterarse, En resumen, Defcon es la conferencia mas
  grande del mundo de Seguridad/Hacking.  Ha estado muy bien a no ser
  por el hecho de que ayer comenzamos con 2 horas de retraso y todas las
  conferencias se movieron obviamente 2 horas, por lo que tuve que re
  acomodar todo el horario que había ya planificado.  Las presentaciones
  no han estado nada mal y han ido desde ingeniería inversa, fuzzing,
  hacking y ahora mismo estoy a la espera de que de inicio una
  presentación sobre la mutación y los motores de metamorfosis
  actualmente usados por virus lo que les hace difícil de erradicar.  El
  próximo podcast que saldrá antes del día Lunes tendrá toda la
  información de la conferencia y cualquier cosa interesante que haya
  sucedido.  Hasta ese entonces.  Peace and Hacking!



 Edicion #55 de Vida Tech!  - Mmmm... no, esta no es la edicion #55 de
 vida tech! es mas bien la edicion #2 de Vida, Estando en la oficina de
 un cliente y aun con mucho trabajo por hacer era casi seguro que no
 podria grabar el podcast de nuevo y la verdad es que no queria dejar de
 hacerlo, pero tampoco habia tenido tiempo de preparar el contenido de
 un podcast de tecnologia como me gusta hacerlo, asi que decidi grabar
 una edicion de Vida!  Aprovecho que fue asi para contarles la
 posibilidad que enfrento de someterme a un tratamiento medico y como
 esto afectaria al podcast de Vida Tech, por lo menos en la regularidad
 con que lo publico, ademas de comentarles a que se debe el tratamiento,
 en resumen, otro podcast fuera de lo normal, eso si, con muy mal
 sonido... pero es que no es lo mismo utilizar un microfono de Diafragma
 grande, Mixer y Compresor a simplemente utilizar un bluetooth
 headset... pero para que les digo mas, ya ustedes escucharan el sonido
 de la grabacion.  Espero si tener tiempo de grabar el podcast regular
 el dia de mañana, por lo pronto me despido... ojala y no se aburran con
 el podcast del dia de hoy... Peace! ;) - No se olviden de visitar la
 pagina y participar de la primera muestra de Podcasts independientes en

NASHUA, N.H., Mar 25, 2008 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Savant Protection, Inc.,
today announced that it has released Version 2.0 of its award winning
Savant end-point security solution. The much anticipated release
provides corporate security officers with a powerful tool specifically
designed to address the rapid propagation of new and targeted crimeware
exploits.

With 2.0, Savant provides the only complementary solution designed to
fortify existing security solutions against the propagation of threats
from internal misuse, external attack and unauthorized change. Savant's
passive deterrence approach presents a very small operational profile
that allows its successful operation while not disrupting how
traditional antivirus and security solutions function. Savant's
comprehensive central management provides the scalability necessary to
meet the requirements of any Windows or Linux enterprise, allowing for
immediate and complete control over all Savant clients, regardless of
time or location.

"One of the most exciting aspects to Information Security is the
innovation driven by need. We continue to push the envelope in Windows,
Linux, and mobile environments," said Ken Steinberg, President/CTO and
founder of Savant Protection, Inc. "We are especially excited about
announcing Intrusion Prevention for production systems and our
enhancements to Compliance reporting through our Application
Intelligence enterprise management interface."

Savant Protection, Inc. invites the immediate download of a fully
functional 30 day trial version of Savant 2.0 in order for corporations
to experience the full impact of this innovation in enterprise security.
Please visit www.savantprotection.com/get-savant.htm to take advantage
of this offer.

Savant technology makes computing systems impervious to the injection
and spread of malicious applications, scripts or changes to the system's
existing soft infrastructure by providing unique cryptographic
signatures to the approved application set on each system. The ability
of unauthorized or unknown applications to execute is denied rendering
it impossible for malicious code to compromise the host system or spread
to other Savant enhanced...  Serious getting-down is to be had here, O
My Brothers, with tribal house, funky electro, and progressive house all
working together like they were made for each other, and all of 'em
definitely made for you.

 You’ve probably heard that the folks in Washington D.C. have finally
 gotten around to raising our nation’s target for fuel economy. Sadly,
 35 miles per gallon (MPG) by 2020 is too little, too late. The
 automakers that merely strive to meet that marker might not be around
 by the time that day rolls around. We need to see substantial
 improvements in a far more compressed time frame.  You can do something
 about it, starting today … even if you can’t find old paint on the list
 of cars that get 30 MPG on the highway (or more). No matter what you
 drive, you can drive more conscientiously. Any vehicle will get higher
 or lower mileage, depending on the way that the driver operates that
 vehicle.  I spent a good part of last weekend behind the wheel of a
 rental car rated at 29 MPG highway.  A fuel-efficiency meter was
 prominently featured on the sedan’s dashboard, between the speedometer
 and tachometer. I was able to better the EPA’s highway rating by 20%
 over hundreds of miles of the highway … simply by driving
 conscientiously.

 Faithful Technobabble readers may remember my long-running obsession
 with space heaters over the years and my decision to purchase the
 bargain electric fireplace (that turned out not to be a bargain in the
 long run).  The electric fireplace landed in our sun room, which for
 many years did double-duty as my home office… that is, until roughly
 around the time that the fireplace arrived, when my home office moved
 back into the smallest bedroom in the house.  I’m not complaining, mind
 you… the alternative space heaters in the office keep things toasty in
 a winter where I’ve been keeping the programmable thermostat turned
 down low, after having dumped more than $1500 of heating oil into the
 tank to this point.  There’s one only one heat duct in the office, but
 the room remains remarkably warmer than the rest of the house when the
 family is home. Between the desktop PC, CRT monitor (remember them?),
 the routers, a VoIP box, a laptop, a 20-inch conventional TV, and the
 boy’s Xbox 360, the room can get downright toasty. Close the office
 door and it will get uncomfortably warm.  The Xbox is a lot of things
 to a lot of people, but around these parts, it’s a fantastic
 alternative space heater. Could the wizards at Microsoft have possibly
 considered this when they designed the beast? A warm woolen hat’s off
 to them, regardless!

 From the Pluri Media Group Archives.  TIMESTAMP: 20 07  History speaks
 of Galactic Masters who left in the framework of the calendar an
 advanced culture and a galactic code, synchronicity of the planets, the
 cycle of the galaxy.  One full galactic ‘turn’ describes the
 circumscription of a given celestial object relative to the core of the
 galaxy, and is inclusive of the conventional 3 Dimensions along with
 the time-gravity influence.  The magnetic polarity of a given celestial
 object is determined by the polarity of the galactic core it circles.
 As the object passes through the electromagnetic “equator” of the
 galactic core, it may experience fluctuations in it’s own otherwise
 stable polarity.  Changes in polarity result in the planet shifted on
 it’s rotational axis, what once was frozen tundra could shift to
 jungle, and once fertile regions now frozen polar wastelands.  As the
 molten core of the planet slowly changes directions, tectonic mantles
 grate together, sparking massive volcanic eruptions and tsunamis.  
 Our computer systems deconvoluted the cyclic nature of extinction
 events.  From the Aztecs, who had inherited their calendar from the
 Maya, the Maya attributed their incredibly complex calendric system as
 well as their passion for studying the solar system and astrological
 divination through numeration and the repetition of cycles to another
 people whose origin was lost in the dim past- (Sumerians) who in turn
 were instructed by (Nephilim), supremely technologically advanced
 extraterrestrial beings.   Cross referencing untold quantities of
 data, the Pluri Media Systems, Controlled and organically modulated, by
 Cortex itself- the heart of the Pluri Media Group Matrix Hive.  Turns
 every 63 million yrs, 5125.4 yr “eras”, the deconvoluted calendar
 confessed the final 5,125 year cycle prior to the next turn started in
 3113 B.C. - A.D. 2012  The Maya-based Aztec calendar places S in the
 center of the calendar. S represents a point of synthesis. We are
 currently in the thirteenth cycle, the cycle of the Transformation of
 Matter spanning the years 1618 to 2012. The last subcycle of this Age
 began in 1992 and ends in 2012.   The glyph for this final subcycle of
 the galactic ‘turn’, as it were, a turn inclusive of both conventional
 3D and time, is Storm followed by Sun; a period of intense darkness
 followed by one of light.   This is where we are today, in the grip of
 a power made apocalyptic idiot king and his hatchet man Dick, Dick
 Cheney, VP of the corporation of America.  As the world is consumed by
 a headlong rush to out consume each other into the final death spiral
 of self annihilation.  But take heed meat puppets, your world will be
 harvested of flesh soon.  The cycle will begin again.  The periodic
 visit of the harvesters- harvest meat.  Yes.  Meat.  Whether it’s
 dinosaur or human, they care not- meat is meat.  And this planet earth
 is ripe indeed… with meat. Best harvested prior to the impending cyclic
 extinction event. TIMESTAMP: 20 07.

Today is part two of my interview with Brian Morrissey of Adweek. I
posted it on Monday here. This is a continuation of the interview where
he discusses Twitter, PR and social media. Thank you Brian for being so
gracious with letting us interview you!     Why Twitter? What got you
started there? I was skeptical about Twitter for a  while, but I joined
last summer, I think, as a way to keep in touch with a  couple friends.
I think someone from Agency.com followed me, which then led to a  few
others. Like any network it grew from there. I never started using it
with  any set plan.  Are you hoping PR people will learn something from
your  missives or are you merely venting (i.e., are we beyond
correction)? I don’t  know, probably both. Since Max wrote that story, I
have a lot more followers  from PR. That’s cool, but I never started
using Twitter as some way to vent  about PR. I guess probably 5 percent
of my posts are about it. One of the  evolutions that I’ve found with
Twitter is my audience expanded to include a lot  more people in the
marketing industry. One of the raps “traditional media” gets  is it’s
inaccessible, unlike blogs with comments and more personal commentary. I
started to use Twitter as a way to bring people into the process a bit,
from  shaping story ideas to learning the frustrations reporters have
with editors,  companies we cover and, yes, PR people. That’s probably
the biggest overall goal  I have with Twitter now, if I have one. It
would be great if new tools like  Twitter enable reporters to close the
gap between what we do and the people who  read it. What I don’t want it
to become is my lectures on PR. It’s not for me to  tell PR people how
to do their jobs. I’m only giving the perspective from my  end.  Where
do most of the conflicts come from? The biggest thing that  frustrates
me is that there’s a disconnect between what PR people say they do  and
what they really do. There’s this idea that they’re there to “help
reporters,” but that’s not true. Their goal, as I see it, is to make
their  client make good, control information and act as gatekeepers.
Those are often in  conflict with what I’m trying  to do. On top of
that, there’s too much spam  coming from PR people. Trust me, I could
write all day about the untargeted,  useless stuff I’m bombarded with.
Some people say “it’s your job,” but it’s not  my job to get spammed. It
actually detracts from my ability to do my job because  of the time it
takes and how often I’m interrupted. What’s most frustrating is  the
majority of PR people really have no idea what I do. If they did, they
wouldn’t be wasting my team with some press release about an industry I
don’t  cover. Yet it seems the industry is in many ways predicated on
“hits,” so the  mentality, like advertising, favors bombardment.  You
recently wrote  about ad agencies not getting social media. That survey
focused mostly on  "traditional" agencies from what I could tell. Do
interactive agencies suffer  from the same problem? I wrote about a
study that found clients don’t think  their agencies “get” social
media.It’s a hard thing because social media is such  a nebulous thing.
I mean, we’re talking about conversations. Those conversations  have
applicability to all parts of a company, from marketing to product
management to public relations to customer service. I find the debate of
“who  will own social media” utterly silly. Nobody will — not marketing,
not PR, not  customer service. I think it’s going to change how
companies organize  themselves.  The other side to that question, what
do you think of PR  agencies use of social media, are we using it
effectively? What would you change  about it?  I don’t know enough about
how PR agencies use social media. I’ll say  this: I’m impressed — or
maybe alarmed — at how many PR people are on services  like Twitter. (I
kid about the alarmed part, btw.) It sounds corny but I’m a big
believer that to really understand it, you have to do it, whether you’re
an ad  guy, PR person, reporter or whatever. It’s a tricky thing;
getting your hands  dirty is absolutely necessary. The question I have
is how PR agencies end up  “using” the channel. A lot of my frustrations
with PR people stem from the same  spray-and-pray approach used by ad
agencies to bombard us with commercial  messages. I get 150+ PR pitches
a day by email and probably a dozen  just-following-up-on-an-email-I
sent calls. That’s why I don’t want Facebook  pitches on top of that.
Will these social media avenues just become another  venue to promote
the hell out of a client? I hope not. And I think it’s  reassuring that
many PR people use Twitter,  because they’ll be less likely to  pollute
environments they use because they’ll empathize with regular users.

 Installing the Nokia PC Suite on your computer has the side effect that
 a Nokia Phone Browser system folder is added to My Computer. I rarely
 connect my Nokia N73 phone to my computer and have never used the icon
 to interact with it which lead to the question how I could remove that
 Nokia entry in My Computer.  I did not want to uninstall the Nokia PC
 Suite because I did need it from time to time. The Nokia Phone Browser
 entry in My Computer is connected to the PhoneBrowser.dll and all that
 has to be done is to unregister the dll in windows to remove the entry
 in My Computer.  Open the command line by pressing Windows R, typing
 cmd and hitting enter. Now navigate to the folder where the Nokia PC
 Suite is installed. In my case it was C:\Program Files\Nokia\Nokia PC
 Suite 6 so I did type “cd C:\Program Files\Nokia\Nokia PC Suite 6″.
 The command to unregister the PhoneBrowser.dll and remove the Nokia
 Phone Browser entry is “regsrv32 /u PhoneBrowser.dll”. Refresh the My
 Computer window to see the change which should be visible immediately.

This article was written by a hardcore Opera fan, known as Stephen. He
enjoys writing, talking about his love for Google and playing around
with Linux. If you're interested in more information about Linux, check
out our previous articles, such as Linux vs. Windows. As an editors
note, Stephen will be joining as an editor here at the AMCP Tech Blog!
Welcome!  Slax is a new Linux distribution, based on slackware. For
those new to the words "Linux", "distribution", "slackware" - I'll go
over them. If you know what they are, just skip to the next paragraph.
Linux is an alternative operating system for computers, like Windows
(Which you might be using). An OS controls everything on the computer,
along with all your interaction with the computer. To some it up, an OS
is the brain of the computer, it instructs it to boot and load programs.
It also understands hardware interaction, such as keyboard strokes and
mouse movements, so it's the most important piece of software on your
computer. Linux comes in distributions or "distros". They're a little
like different flavors of ice cream, or different versions of Windows,
like Windows Me, 98, XP, or Vista. Linux has numerous distros, which are
most generally free, and downloadable. Linux has many advantages over
Windows, such as security, pricing and it offer a unique way of running.
Linux can be run over a network, a flash drive, a CD, or from the
traditional hard drive. This is most useful when looking around at Linux
distros, or for first time Linux users wanting to learn Linux.  Linux
has many advantages of Windows, but which Linux distribution is the
best? Well, unlike the Windows world, there is no such thing as one
being better than the other. Each Linux distro is suited for one
person's taste. So why Slax? Slax ability to run of a Flash drive or CD
was the most unique for me. While running off of a CD is slower than
running off a hard-drive, a Flash drives are the fastest media most
computers can handle. So using and booting Slax, from a Flash drive is a
big plus, not too mention that it's more portable than a CD.  Slax runs
the KDE interface, along with the XFCE interface additionally. Slax by
default comes with only minimal programs, decreasing the size of the
download, which is a major plus for dialup users. But, not to fear, Slax
can have plenty of extra power, with things called, "modules". Modules
are additional programs that you download, and place in your module's
folder. This makes installing and uninstalling overly easy, because all
you do is place/delete the file, a big plus over traditional Linux
program installs. So, it's really easy for the first time Linux to use,
all you do is stick it in and boot from it, and now your using Linux.
Congrats, you've entered the relm of open source software, where the
greedy claws of Microsoft can no longer harm you!  Now that we know that
it's easy, the next question is, "Can I use my regular Linux programs
instead of these little module things?" Well, although this is possible
from a Flash drive, it is most practical to use it in the for of modules
because modules stay, which unlike prorgrams, aren't deleted once you
unplug your Flash drive or CD. That is why you either make a module
based off of a slackware package or you search through the 1,000+ module
database for what you want. There is the module for everything that
you'll need; All you have to do is find it.  Wrapping it up, you went
from really easy to understand to a complicated answer, but I think I
heard you say that you want keep your changes? Well, that would be
LiveCD's downfall. But, that feature is great for certain situations.
Because it's the same thing every time you reboot, this is exactly what
your local school and library should be using, because anything
installed, written or broken is gone. This is useful for first time
Linux users because lets say you were messing with settings, then all of
a sudden you clicked the wrong thing and now you don't know how to get
it back. But if you want to save your settings, simply run this:
configsave/dev/sda1/boot/modules  Now your settings are saved and
restored everytime! Now, for the people that are too lazy to read the
full artice above: Slax is a free, Live Linux distro, which runs from
either USB or a Flash drive. You don't have to install any applications
you don't want, it's no bloated, it's fast, and it's secure. This can do
what I want, when I want it to, and how I want it to. So is that all
correct? Absolutely, except I forgot to mention that it's really
portable.
       I'm currently reading a pretty good book by Lawrence Lessig
       called Free Culture: The Nature and Future of Creativity. It's a
       very interesting analysis of the state of copyright law in the
       United States that takes a look at the past, the present and the
       future. I'm only half-way through, but I still heartily recommend
       it.   If, like me, you don't live in the US, you're probably
       wondering why you should care about US copyright law and US
       lobbies, etc. Well, simply put, because bad ideas have a tendency
       to escape the United States and spread throughout the world, like
       a tumor spreads its deadly tentacles throughout a healthy body
       (and there you go, I'm now probably banned for life from entry to
       the United States for exercising one of the rights Americans
       appreciate the most.)   Anyway, if you do not have the time to
       read the actual book (freely available from the book's web site,
       by the way) or you do not like reading in English, you might want
       to take a look at this presentation that, even though it does not
       really summarize the book, does cover some of its main points:



  Identity theft is when someone pretends to be a different person in
  order to commit a crime, generally by using personal information of
  the victim and/or a little bit of social engineering.   I guess that
  by this definition I was not really a victim of identity theft since I
  was the one impersonating myself. Here's the whole story:   The city
  of Paris recently launched a service of bike loans called Vélib'. I
  call them loans rather than rentals because for a mere 30€ for one
  year, you get the right to borrow a bike for free as often as you
  want. When the service launched I obviously got a subscription because
  I love bikes (I haven't been able to use it much because of the
  traveling, but that's another story) and associated it with my
  underground pass because both RFID systems are compatible.   A few
  weeks ago I got a new underground card because the old one expired.
  Even though both the underground and Vélib' use the same tags, they do
  not share databases and the new tag I received was therefore not
  associated to my Vélib' subscription. I knew that updating the
  information was very simple, I just didn't know how much. And this is
  where my identity auto-theft comes in.   Today I was walking around
  Paris with a friend who told me that all I had to do was call Vélib'
  and give them my new tag number. I was a little skeptical, since I
  didn't think I had a way to authenticate myself to the service. I was
  extremely naive, though. We called Vélib' and, literally, all I had to
  do was give them my full name and the number of the new tag and it was
  activated immediately. This pretty much means that anybody with a
  valid tag that knows my full name could very well steal my
  subscription at any time simply by calling a telephone number! I'm
  still having a hard time believing it...   The situation is actually
  quite paradoxical since I really do appreciate the simplicity of the
  whole process, but you'd have to be an alien no to know that there are
  very few places on Earth where such trust can actually take place. And
  let me tell you that Paris is definitively not amongst them.   When
  professionals talk about security, there's three terms that make up
  their basic vocabulary and which can never be mistaken:
  identification, authentication and authorization. In cases where
  security is a concern (and given the potential damages that could come
  from Vélib' subscription theft, I guess this is one of them)
  understanding these terms properly, and especially the difference
  between the first two is vital.   Vélib' is not the first (and will
  definitively not be the last) to assume that identification is enough
  to perform an important transaction. Take credit cards for example.
  For a long time, and it's still the case in many places, a credit card
  transaction consisted of swiping a piece of plastic on a machine and
  then signing a slip that nobody really cared about. I guess the
  signature was supposed to serve as authentication, but I'm willing to
  bet that there's a huge amount of X's and other drawings that were
  used instead of signatures and the credit cards still got charged.
  Today more and more credit card companies and banks use microchips on
  their cards in order to be able to authenticate the bearer thanks to a
  PIN, which is a lot more secure. It just so happens that I also have a
  PIN associated to my Vélib' account...   I do not know how much Vélib'
  and the RATP (the company that runs the underground and provides the
  RFID tag that I'm using for both) share information. There's always
  the possibility that the person who answered the phone was able to
  check the name associated to my tag and only then perform the change.
  But I seriously doubt this.        Photo credit: JenWaller



 OK, time to go total fanboy here for just a minute or two.  I’ve been
 waiting for this moment to arrive for quite some time now.  Of all the
 rumors that fly around about Apple and iPods and iTunes, there’s one
 that I’ve always really wished would come true.  I’ve always wanted to
 get The Beatles into iTunes.  And now, apparently, that’s exactly what
 we’re going to have.  I couldn’t be more pumped.  Now, arguably the
 greatest and most influential band in the history of rock and roll will
 have their music available for you and I to purchase on our computers
 and load onto our lovely little iPods.  This rocks.  On so many
 different levels.  Think about it, this is the final validation that
 downloading music online, legally, is how we’ll all be buying all of
 our music within the next few years.  Call me an idiot, but I think
 that we’ll see the end of CD sales in retail stores within 5 years. 
 That’s how big this news is.  This is more than just another band
 deciding to sell their music online.  It’s the Beatles.  Did you hear
 me?  THE BEATLES.  Not just another band, but THE BAND.  The band that
 all other bands are judged by.  I know I’m really deep into fanboy
 land, but just deal with it.  This is big news.  I’m sitting here
 trying to find the exact words to describe just how important that this
 is, but I just can’t.  It’s big.  Earth-shattering, even.  Thank God I
 still have some credits left from Christmas.  I’ll be using all of them
 as soon as the tracks become available.  You should too.  Tags:

  Today we launched the TechEd U.S. registration web site with a blog
  posting from Steve Guggenheimer "Guggs", General Manager of
  Microsoft's Application Platform and Developer Marketing.  Steve
  announced the theme of this year's event (Be a part of the experience)
  as well as the return of Bill Gates and Bob Muglia as the keynote
  speakers.  It was two years ago during the week of TechEd Boston that
  Bill announced his departure from Microsoft scheduled in 2008 (picture
  to the right was from that press announcement with Steve Ballmer), and
  ironically he will be returning to Keynote TechEd as one of his last
  speaking engagements while at Microsoft exactly two years later.  At
  the end of February we will be launching a more robust and "cooler"
  web site showcasing SilverLight and most importantly the line up of
  more than 1,600 sessions and labs at this year's event.  It's going to
  be a great year and I'm ecstatic to see the event take shape.  More
  TechEd websites will be coming online over the course of the following
  months along with the debut of TechEd Online, the global portal to
  TechEd worldwide.     More to come!
Crossposted from: Stop The ACLU  Iraqi Prime Minister Al Maliki and
General Casey have announced that it is official that Abu Musab
Al-Zarqawi has been killed in a US Air raid. He has been positively
identified by finger prints. Also killed in the raid were 7 of his
henchmen.  FoxNews reports:  BAGHDAD, Iraq  — Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the
Al Qaeda-linked militant who led a bloody campaign of suicide bombings,
kidnappings and hostage beheadings in Iraq, has been killed in a U.S.
air raid north of Baghdad, Iraq's prime minister said Thursday.
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said al-Zarqawi was killed along with
seven aides Wednesday evening in a house 30 miles northeast of Baghdad
in the volatile province of Diyala.  "Today, al-Zarqawi was eliminated,"
al-Maliki told a news conference, drawing loud applause from reporters
as he was flanked by U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and U.S. Gen.
George Casey, the top U.S. commander in Iraq.  Al-Maliki said the air
strike was the result of intelligence reports provided to Iraqi security
forces by residents in the area, and U.S. forces acted on the
information.  "Those who disrupt the course of life, like Al-Zarqawi,
will have a tragic end," he said.  Khalilzad added "the death of Abu
Musab Al-Zarqawi is a huge success for Iraq and the international war on
terror."  The Jordanian-born militant, who is believed to have
personally beheaded at least two American hostages, became Iraq's most
wanted militant, as notorious as Usama bin Laden, to whom he swore
allegiance in 2004. The United States put a $25 million bounty on his
head, the same as bin Laden.  Iraqi Police were first on the scene after
the airstrike. And it has been reported that Jordanian officials were
invoved in pinpointing his location based on some recent video tape.
Reports out of Baghdad state that information to Zarqawi's location came
from local residents tipping off the Iraqi Police and Security forces.
One report even says that it was a member of Zarqawi's inner circle that
gave the key information.  Zarqawi was holding a meeting inside a
"safe-house" about 30 miles north of Baghdad.  It is ironic that Zarqawi
has been killed less than 20 miles from where Saddam Hussain was found
hiding in that spider hole.  It is hoped that with the death of Zarqawi
that the insurgency will start to fall apart and the differing sides in
Iraq will finally come together and solve their problems.  Fox is
reporting that long standing ovations and cheering at the announcement
of Zarqawi's death. Even the press corps!  There is speculation that
also killed in the attack was Zarqawi's #2 Sheikh Abdul Rahman. Rahman
you may remember was the center of the initial insurgency.  The
airstrike took place at about 1815 (6:15 pm) 7 June Baghdad time.
Official announcement of Zarqawi's death didn't come until 0900 (9am) 8
June Baghdad time suggesting that there was no rush to judgement on the
identification of Zarqawi's body.  Bush Congratulates the troops.
President Bush said Thursday that the death of al-Qaida leader Abu Musab
al-Zarqawi is "a severe blow" to the al-Qaida terrorist network and a
decisive victory in the U.S.-led war against terorrism.   "Now Zarqawi
has met his end," Bush said in the White House Rose Garden. "And this
violent man will never murder again."   Bush listed some of the most
visible terror operations that Zarqawi led or masterminded including the
bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Iraq, the beheading of American
hostages and the assassinatio of a U.S. diplomat in Jordan.   Bush
praised the work of the U.S. military and Iraqi allies in killing
Zarqawi, but was careful to point out that this singular development
will not end terror attacks in Iraq.   But not everyone is celebrating.
Nick Berg's father is saddened.
 The iPhone and the Voyager have been duking it out in the ring of
 public opinion (and the iPhone has been kicking butt, incidentally),
 but not every review has done a feature by feature comparison of the
 two phones: “Lets layout some of the facts and features of both phones
 up against each other. The Apple iPhone as most of the “fans” and
 owners know does not have the 3G network support (built-in hardware)
 but the LG Voyager does. With that advantage over the iPhone it will
 attract the high-speed junkies of newer integrated PDA cell phones. One
 downside of this and what was most surprising to me was the LG Voyager
 does not have WI-FI. Ouch, that hurt when I typed it out, once again,
 the LG Voyager does not have WI-FI. I guess what some of you may be
 thinking now is why bother with WI-FI when you have a dedicated 3G
 network support (where available) at your fingertips, literally. Good
 point but is it really when we it comes down the battery life (Steve
 Jobs is laughing right now).” Read the rest of the article here

 On this EverythingTech I demonstrate how you can add or edit ID3 tags
 from your MP3’s using iTunes.  So what is an ID3 tag? Wikipeda states:
 “ID3 is a metadata container most often used in conjunction with the
 MP3 audio file format. It allows information such as the title, artist,
 album, track number, or other information about the file to be stored
 in the file itself.” I was putting the finishing touches on the latest
 GeekFit Podcast which is when I load the file into iTunes and copy over
 some of the ID3 tags to be used in the current podcast file. I thought
 I should show everyone how the process works and give a small demo for
 all to see.  ID3 tags are important for podcasters since most of the
 time people download them MP3 file without visiting the podcasters
 site. By putting in all the info you would want your listeners to know
 into the mp3 file’s ID3 tag you’ve given your listener another way of
 knowing who made the podcast and how to contact you.  iTunes isn’t THE
 BEST program to change ID3 tags, but it is a program lots of people
 use. Later I’ll uncover a few more applications that do this same
 function and some that even automate the process.  revver(119363) Share

 Over 300 people have suggested via Skribit that I chime in on what’s
 involved with maintaining, writing and developing for this blog. With
 this post I aim to cover every aspect of how I work and keep
 PaulStamatiou.com rolling. Some things might be common sense while
 others might make you wonder. Enjoy.
Workspace
 As part of my 2008 new year’s resolution, I plan on maintaining a
 clutter free workspace. When I got back to Atlanta for the new semester
 I threw out things I didn’t need, sent home several boxes of clothes I
 didn’t wear, gear I didn’t use and stuff I just didn’t need at this
 point. You can see what I’m left with in this quick video below. If
 you’re reading this in an RSS reader, you might want to click through
 if the video doesn’t show up here.


Video is 20.85MB with an original resolution of 720×405. It’s kinda
cheesy too.
 Some of you might be asking what happened to my 30-inch Dell display.
 It’s still boxed up in my closet from finals week when I put it away to
 reclaim my desk. I’m actually in the process of selling it. After
 reassessing my needs, I think it’s just too big for what I do (however,
 it was great for watching movies from my bed). I have been doing well
 on just my MacBook Pro’s screen with Spaces in Leopard. At most I’ll
 sprout for a 24-inch Dell that has multimedia inputs so it can serve
 multiple purposes (Vudu, Blu-ray player, et cetera) as the older
 30-inch only has a single DVI input.
Personal Technology
 As I’ve mentioned many times here and there, my main and only computer
 is a 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo 15-inch (glossy) MacBook Pro with 4GB of OCZ
 DDR2 and OS X Leopard. I’ve ditched my Logitech MX Revolution mouse for
 my older Logitech G5 mouse. The MX Revolution battery life was slowly
 getting worse and the charger was just thing to add clutter.  I have
 two chargers for the MacBook Pro - one stays wired up in my desk and
 the other is wrapped up and ready to go with me should I find the need
 to head out with the MacBook Pro. For long flights to California and
 road trips I also have another battery. On trips, I always bring a
 Nikon D80 digital camera with a 4GB SDHC card and if necessary a
 Panasonic HDC-SD5 camcorder with an 8GB SDHC card. Unfortunately, the
 SD5 is now out of date.. blasted CES salting my game.  While I can live
 with the resolution on the MacBook Pro, I can’t make due with the
 internal speakers for too long. Whenever I’m back in my room I always
 plug in my Logitech Z-2200 2.1 speakers (discontinued). I’ve had them
 for 5 years and they have been working well ever since and were very
 affordable. The same goes for my trusty HP LaserJet 1012
 (discontinued). It prints fast, doesn’t take up too much space and was
 cheap. I recommended its replacement in my realistic back to school
 guide for college students.  I have an old external FireWire Maxtor
 OneTouch 300GB drive for storing media only, with most of this being
 purchased TV episodes and movies from the iTunes Store that I no longer
 need taking up space on my MacBook Pro. There might be a hundred gigs
 of Top Gear and Fifth Gear episodes on there too. I only access my
 external drive maybe once every 3 months so things on there are not
 really vital.
The Online Life
 Everything else not on my external drive is in an Internet cloud. I
 don’t keep much, except for things I am currently working on, on my
 local machine. All of the pictures I take are immediately uploaded to
 my Flickr account and then deleted from my computer. To date I have
 around 9,300 photos on Flickr.  I have roughly 24.4GB of personal
 documents, server backups, iTunes music and more on my Amazon S3
 account. Of course, an Amazon S3 account is only as secure as the
 password on the Amazon account tied to the AWS account, so my Amazon
 password changes very often.
This particular S3 bucket on the right is where I store my miscellaneous
school-related work.
 I interact with Amazon S3 exclusively with Panic’s Transmit app. As you
 might imagine, the problem with storing files online is that it will
 take some time to upload. Most documents I have on S3 are small and
 several megabytes at most, with the larger 100MB+ zip and media files I
 have on there being uploaded from campus with a much faster Internet
 connection. Music is backed up to S3 with the help of Bandwagon,
 although people with large media collections will probably be better
 off just backing up to an external disk occasionally.  I keep the same
 online mentality with my email. I have Google Apps Premier edition for
 my email account and write emails with the web interface only. I’ve
 tried using Mail and Thunderbird, but I’m just too used to the web
 interface. One of the things people might have an issue with Google
 Apps is remembering the longer URL to check email:
 https://mail.google.com/a/[DOMAIN]. You can get around this by setting
 up a CNAME record for your domain - for example, mine is
 http://m.pstam.com. The only problem with that is it just redirects to
 the longer URL which takes some time and it goes back to using HTTP and
 not HTTPS. Regardless, it’s not too big of a deal.
I spent a few days replying to email to clear out my inbox for the new
year.
 I have IMAP enabled with Google Apps so I can use the same account from
 my iPhone easily. I also have the Google Apps setting that allows me to
 have the newest version of Gmail first. As for organization, I make use
 of several labels and have filters setup to automatically sort emails.
 Steve Rubel has a few articles dedicated to living the online life by
 keeping organized online.  Just as I enjoy the web interface for
 checking email, I also use the WordPress admin panel rather than OS X
 blogging software. I also enjoy the clutter free feel of not having to
 install extra software on my computer.

OS X Things I Can’t Live Without
 I’ve mentioned Spaces in Leopard numerous times and this post is no
 exception. Spaces has honed my productivity quite a bit. Back in the
 summer of 2006, I wrote an article called Why I’m More Productive on a
 Mac that got around quite a bit. If I had to add one thing to that
 article since its publication, it would be Spaces. I still use Exposé
 just as much, but Spaces let me setup playpens for various tasks and
 keep related items in their proper place.
Safari, iTunes, Development Env (Firefox, Textmate, Terminal)
 Spotlight in Leopard is like lightning. I actually stopped using
 QuickSilver for it. I know QuickSilver can do a billion and a half
 things but I only ever used it for changing songs in iTunes and
 launching apps. Spotlight can launch apps just as well and I can use
 Spotlight as a spell-checker of sorts. Going along with my whole
 clutter free ideal, QuickSilver one less application that needs to be
 running.
Type a word in Spotlight and you’ll be greeted by the dictionary entry
if spelled correctly.
 The Inquisitor plugin for Safari 3 is quite dandy as well.
Ron Paul messed up my #2 Google spot. I wonder who’s not getting my
vote.
 This seems to be turning into a more of why I love Leopard piece but
 QuickLook and its hacks are also massive timesavers. And of course I
 need all of the regulars: Adobe CS3 Suite, TextMate, Transmit, Adium,
 Firefox for Firebug debugging, Safari 3 for browsing and Google
 Notifier for checking my Google Apps email 24/7.
Server & Blog Stuff
 PaulStamatiou.com has been hosted by Media Temple for over 2 years on
 their dedicated-virtual box. It gives me the control I need to tinker
 with the OS to my liking. I have written a script to backup server
 files and databases to a backup bucket on Amazon S3. Updating the blog
 CMS I use, WordPress, is as easy as a single command with SVN.  Last
 year I left Mint stats tracking for Google Analytics for speed issues -
 particularly database lag.

 However, Google Analytics only updates stats every midnight PST so I
 don’t get the live information I did with Mint. Fortunately, all that
 information is stored in the Apache web server’s log and is easily
 accessible if you know a lick or two of Linux.  Before going into the
 details, I’ll say that a lot of the server maintenance and tinkering I
 do is over the SSH protocol. That is, I fire up Terminal in OS X (PuTTY
 for Windows users) and enter in something like
ssh username@domain.com
 and then the password. Upon a successful connection, I have the command
 line for my server at my disposal - basic stuff for anyone that has
 messed with a server at least once. After a while, typing out
 username@domain.com gets annoying which is why I edited the local SSH
 config file for OS X.  By adding an alias to ~/.ssh/config I no longer
 have to type out my long username and domain name and can just type in
 something like ssh ps. If you want to try it out for yourself, open up
 the Terminal in OS X and run:
vi ~/.ssh/config
 and add an alias in this form:
Host aliasname HostName yourdomain.com User yourusername
 If you were to save that in your local SSH config file, you would be
 able to ssh into your server with just ssh aliasname instead of ssh
 yourusername@yourdomain.com. With a long name like mine, it saves quite
 a bit of time in the long run. It’s also a good idea to disable root
 login via SSH and enable key-based SSH authentication for security.
 Once I have a command line for my server, I can run a small script to
 show the top 20 referrers in the day so far (logs are rotated everyday
 automatically). This script also takes out certain referrers like
 bloglines that would otherwise dominate the top 20, and unlike JS
 analytics services it shows all requests making it helpful for finding
 hotlinkers. (Note: the script is only 2 lines should you paste it and
 it be broken into more. Also, the location of your access_log will
 vary.)
#!/bin/bash sudo awk ‘{print $11}’
/var/www/vhosts/paulstamatiou.com/statistics/logs/access_log | grep -v
‘paulstamatiou.com’ | grep -v ‘bloglines.com’  | grep -v ‘”-”‘ | grep -v
‘feedburner.com’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
 The same goes with another frequently used script that shows the number
 requests for the past day:
#!/bin/bash TODAY=$(date +%d/%b) sudo grep “$TODAY”
/var/www/vhosts/paulstamatiou.com/statistics/logs/access_log | awk
‘{print $1}’ | sort | uniq | wc -l
 Mike Malone has an article detailing how to grep through your web logs.
 However if it’s live stats you want, I’ve come to like apache-top. It’s
 like the Linux command “top” but for Apache as you’ll see.
Apache-top shows pretty much everything and you can cycle through
screens with “d”.
 I usually don’t fire up apache-top unless my site makes it on digg or
 del.icio.us popular and I want to see requests/second or other such
 metrics. I used to login to SSH so frequently that I wanted to maintain
 my sessions and began using the screen command that David Ulevitch
 showed me how to use.. but I’ve since forgotten all the keystrokes and
 only SSH in nightly or so.
WordPress
 Back-tracking to my WordPress setup a bit, I’ve received numerous
 questions about what plugins I use. I try to keep it light but there
 are several plugins I’ve become accustomed to using.

Custom Query String Full Text Feed - How I can use the <!––more––> tag
in posts to truncate them after a few lines and still have full posts in
my RSS feed twitterRSS for my Twitter bar Subscribe to Comments WP-Cache
- Although I would be using WP-Supercache if I had the time to install
it Show Top Commentators Related Posts Random Redirect - for the button
to show random posts WPhone - for moderating comments on the fly on my
iPhone

Images in Posts
 Most images I publish are slightly touched up in Photoshop CS3. If an
 image seems slightly blurry and could benefit from “crisping” up a bit,
 I’ll run an unsharp mask filter under Filter » Sharpen » Unsharp Mask….
 I usually set the amount to anywhere from 50 - 100% depending on the
 degree of “crispness” desired with a radius of 0.5 pixels and a
 threshold of 0. This is for images only as it can make screenshots look
 worse.

 I also tinker with Levels and Brightness/Contrast. I often resort to
 using Auto Levels, Auto Contrast and Auto Color but sometimes their
 results are too dramatic and I’ll go in manually and fine tune things.
 For very dark photos, I will increase the brightness while decreasing
 contrast. However, this result can be achieved better in Levels if I
 have the time to accurately play with the sliders.
Keeping Up with Tech News
 One of the most frequently asked questions I get is how I manage to
 keep up-to-date with all of the tech news out there. Do I spend all of
 my time reading feeds? Nope. This might be a shock to some of you, but
 I hardly use RSS. I have many RSS subscriptions in Google Reader that I
 might check if I am absolutely bored and/or can’t think of anything to
 write about.

 Instead, I follow a handful of influential tech news websites and
 manually visit the blogs of friends and so on. However, if you’ve been
 reading for a while you have probably noticed that more and more of my
 content is less news-based and more original content like this post and
 other reviews. I don’t like being one in a pack and would rather
 differentiate myself from what everyone else is talking about. Although
 there are those big tech stories from time to time that my geekdom
 can’t help but cover.  Here are some of the larger sites I follow
 regularly.

Anandtech News.com Yahoo! Tech Tom’s Hardware Engadget ArsTechnica The
Inquirer dzone The Register Reddit: Programming YC Hacker News NY Times
Tech del.icio.us popular TUAW BBC Tech MIT Technology Review

 I also get wind of interesting articles from people that send them my
 way on del.icio.us by tagging them for:pstamatiou or through people I
 follow on Twitter. And not to mention through the press releases that
 land in my inbox from time to time.  I follow too many blogs to list so
 here’s my OPML, which you can easily import into Google Reader or your
 preferred RSS aggregator. Is your awesome blog missing from my
 subscriptions? Leave a comment and I’ll be sure to check it out.
What Else?
 Is there anything else you’d like to know about what is involved with
 running PaulStamatiou.com? Now to get back to the OLPC..

 OLPC Story: My friend Mike Wozniak (who knows enough about Linux to
 reverse engineer router firmware and cross compile the kernel) got in
 on the Give One Get One OLPC deal. On Saturday we went out to a bar
 with the OLPC obviously left back in his room. He checked Twitter later
 on to see that his roommate twittered “Just kernel panic’d an OLPC“.
 The moral of the story being that you need to hide your OLPC from your
 computer science major roommates.  If you enjoyed this post, let me
 know by leaving a comment.




 With U.S. civil and military officials increasingly concerned about
 cyber attacks against American networks, the U.S. Air Force is planning
 to establish what will probably be the largest and most comprehensive
 military organization to defend against cyber attack. And, unlike the
 apparent efforts of the other U.S. military services in this field, the
 Air Force will conduct offensive cyber warfare.



  The massive Air Force effort will pull together existing cyber-related
  units and establish new ones, all under the Air Force Cyber Command --
  AFCYBER in milspeak -- and its operating arm, the 24th Air Force.
  According to Major General William T. Lord, the provisional commander
  of AFCYBER, the command and 24th Air Force will achieve "initial
  operational capability" on 1 October 2008. However, many components of
  the command are already operational.

  Two new wings are being established to work with two existing wings.
  The total strength of the new commands have not been established, but
  they will be "large," with active, Air Force Reserve, and Air National
  Guard personnel assigned. The AFCYBER/24th Air Force headquarters are
  at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, on an interim basis; the permanent base
  for those headquarters will be decided shortly.   Operating directly
  under AFCYBER will be the Network Operations unit, which will develop
  the standards and integration architecture for the command. All other
  major components are line units under the 24th Air Force; these will
  be:

  67th Network Warfare Wing (Lackland AFB, Texas) -- This is the core of
  Air Force cyber operations. Its official functions are to organize,
  train, and equipment "cyberspace" forces to conduct network defense,
  attack, and exploitation. It is believe that this is the only U.S.
  military organization that carries out extensive offensive cyber
  operations.

  Under Colonel Joseph J. Pridotkas, the 67th is the largest "wing" in
  the Air Force, consisting of five intelligence groups with 35
  squadrons and detachments comprising more than 8,000 men and women.
  They serve at about 100 locations on every continent except
  Antarctica.

  450th Electronic Warfare Wing (Lackland AFB, Texas) -- Consisting of
  electronic attack as well as protection components, this wing will
  provide operational input for Air Force EC-130J Commando Solo
  (Hercules) as well as EA-6B Prowler electronic aircraft. The latter
  are flown by Navy and Marine Corps squadrons, but with some Air Force

  688th Information Operations Wing (Lackland AFB, Texas) -- Formerly
  known as the Air Force Information Operations Center, this wing
  integrates information warfare tactics, training, and technology.

  689th Cyberspace Wing (Scott AFB, Illinois) -- Responsible for
  communications and information functions as well as deployable
  communications capabilities, the wing is assuming the functions now
  performed by the Air Force Communications Agency and the Global
  Cyberspace Innovation Center. (Those commands will be deactivated when
  AFCYBER becomes operational).

  The Air Force leadership believes that the AFCYBER command and its
  components will provide the necessary capabilities and expertise for
  "cyber warfare" in the 21st Century. The command is being established
  at a time that thousands of efforts are being made every day to break
  into Department of Defense databanks and links, and when there will be
  increasing efforts by potential military enemies as well as terrorist
  to wage cyber warfare against the United States.

 I've added a couple features to my NaughtyWordChars plugin. It now
 handles comments as well as entries, and I've added some extra clean-up
 for entry titles (more on that below). You can download the lastest
 verison of the plugin here.

 So, lots of HuffPost bloggers paste their posts titles in from Word
 files. Every so often, someone pastes in a title with extra space and
 the begining or end. Even worse, sometimes people paste in titles with
 line-breaks around them. Since we base our individual archive filenames
 on the entry title, this causes some ugliness.

 For instance, if someone copies something like this:



 and pastes it into the title field; something like this comes out the
 other end:



 Which is obviously no good. Even worse, MT generates an different url
 to use in MTPermalink tags:



 After a bunch of digging around, I gave up on a normal pre_save plugin
 to handle the problem. Seems that (even with a high priority) MT
 generates the filename for an entry before a pre_save plugin is
 applied. [Apparently I should have read the docs for MT::Callback a
 little more carefully. Thanks to Brad for showing me the way.]

 What I emerged with a BigPAPI-reliant solution. It sticks some
 javascript on the page to clean up a post's title before it's
 submitted. I've been running it for a few days on HuffPost, and it
 seems to do the trick nicely.

 Also, thanks to Joshua Kaufman for the suggestion on comments. The
 plugin now optionally cleans them too.

 I spent some more time with CouchDB yesterday. Something useful to do
 while my work project is compiling  I’m considering building some
 simple applications with CouchDB to figure out what the applications of
 CouchDB are and its limitations. Maybe a blog application or something
 like that. For now I’m dabbling a bit, trying to create some reasonable
 databases together. I wrote a little Python script that imports an
 Outlook CSV file (coming from Gmail — don’t worry) into an address book
 database. Now I run simple queries on this data set, such as:
 function(doc) {   if(doc.lastname == ‘Hemel’) {     map(doc.firstname,
 {’name’: doc.firstname + ‘ ‘ + doc.lastname, ‘email’: doc.email});   }
 } Which gives me back the full names of all people in my family and
 their email addresses. Not particularly useful, but hey, it’s
 something. Currently I have a script running that pulls the last 20
 messages from twitter every minute and dumps them in a database. This
 stuff is easy to do because CouchDB’s documents are free form, you can
 dump any simple hashtable into it, including the one that the Python
 Twitter API returns. Here’s my script: import twitter, couchdb, time s
 = couchdb.Server(’http://localhost:5984′) db = s[’twitter’] # use
 ‘twitter’ database ta = twitter.Api() while True:   for s in
 ta.GetPublicTimeline():     dict = s.AsDict()     try: # Hacky way to
 check if message is already in the database       dummy =
 db[str(dict[’id’])]     except:       db[str(dict[’id’])] = dict # If
 not, store it       print ‘Added new message: %d’ % dict[’id’]  
 time.sleep(60) Why am I doing this? Dunno, need some data to play with
 and have to see what interesting information I can extract from this.
 For instance, to figure out which twitterers are from the Netherlands,
 I have the following query: function(doc) {  
 if(doc.user.location.toLowerCase().indexOf(’netherlands’) != -1) {    
 map(doc.user.screen_name, doc);   } } One application of CouchDB I
 found already it simply a database to play with data without putting
 too much thought into. Dabbling.

 If you don’t already have survey fatigue, please consider helping out
 these librarians (and library school students) with their surveys:
 Survey about reference transactions [From Danielle Theiss-White] My
 colleagues and I are working on a book chapter about capturing
 reference transactions and could use your help.  We have developed a
 survey asking how other libraries are capturing their reference
 transactions and would like you to take it!  We will be using the data
 compiled from the survey in our research.  Please consider taking this
 survey if you are currently capturing your reference transactions in
 some manner (paper tally sheet, web-based reference transaction
 tracker, desktop application, etc.).  The survey should take less than
 10 minutes to complete.  The survey is located here:
 https://online.ksu.edu/Survey/take/takeSurvey.do?offeringId=81367
 Please send comments or suggestions to Danielle Theiss-White at
 dtheiss@ksu.edu, Kristin Whitehair at kwhitehair@kumc.edu, or Jason
 Coleman at coleman@ksu.edu.  Survey of Computer Self-Efficacy of
 Academic Library Workers This survey is for a library school project
 and I’ll be curious to see the results.  [From Jennifer Macaulay] The
 main portion of the survey contains questions that are intended to
 calculate people’s level of computer self-efficacy. There have been
 several studies which look at worker’s attitudes towards computers and
 technologies, but none have been done on library workers. In order to
 limit the scope of the survey, I chose to limit my research to academic
 library workers.



  주말에는 현재 사용하고 있는 모 통신회사의 인터넷전화를 추가로 신청해서
  사용해봤다.
우려했던 것 처럼 품질이 나쁘지는 않았고 단말기 역시 깔끔하게 잘 나왔다.
예전에 ADSL에서 FON AP붙이고 PDA로 Skype 테스트 했을 때는 별로 였는데,
광랜으로 바뀐 탓인지 아니면 같이 새로이 설치한 AP탓인지 혹은
전화단말기가 좋아서인지 일반 전화와 통화품질의 차이를 거의 느끼지
못했다.  주변 사람들 말이나 설치기사의 말에 의하면 일반형 단말기가
고급형 단말기보다 오히려 더 통화품질이 좋다고 하니 참고할 것.

설치하고 우리집 네트웍 환경에 맞게 AP를 설정하면서 보안상 문제가 될
것이라고 느낀 점 몇가지.  SSID가 모조리 같으니까 무조건 설치만 해주고
가버린 일반 가정집 같은 경우에는 네트웍이 개방되어 버릴 수 있다. 물론
WEP키로 보안설정이 되지만 그 WEP키가 모조리 같으니까 그 키만 알고 있다면
윗집이나 아랫집의 AP에 무단으로 접속이 가능하다는 것.  그와 연결해서
생각해 볼때 당연히 AP의 관리자페이지에도 접속할 수 있고, 어떤
클라이언트가 붙어 있는지도 알 수 있겠다.  다른 폰들은 어떨 지 모르겠지만
이 인터넷 전화기의 경우 접속된 IP의 특정포트를 통해서 주소록등에 접근할
수 있다. (..고는 매뉴얼에 나와 있는데 나는 아직 성공하지 못했다.
되는거야 안되는거야... 어쨋거나 된다는 가정하에...) 이렇게 되면 당연히
다른 집의 전화기에 들어있는 내용들을 볼 수 있다는 것.  AP에 무단으로
붙어서 인터넷 쓰는 정도까지야 그렇다 쳐도 이런 정도까지 가면 문제가
심각하지 않나 하는 생각이다.

설치해줄 때 AP접속 암호정도는 소비자에게 물어서 변경해주고 가야 향후
문제가 발생할 가능성이 적지 않을까 하는 생각이 든다.  물론 매뉴얼에도 다
나와 있으니 책임은 소비자 쪽으로 돌아가겠지만, 일반 가정집에서 이러한
네트웍 설정까지 세부적으로 건드릴 수 있는 사람이 몇이나 되겠는가.

혹시라도 최근에 공격적인 마케팅으로 모 인터넷전화를 설치한 가정이 있다면
반드시 AP의 관리자 암호와 WEP키를 바꾸기를 권장하는 바이다. 개인적으로는
추가적으로 SSID의 이름도 바꾸고 broadcasting을 꺼두었다.

 Liam has posted a great article on configuring SharePoint to search
 Lotus Notes.    The post reminded me that I missed out a part of the
 configuration steps - how to get the titles to show up correctly. By
 default, the search results display the GUID of the Notes document
 which isn't pretty. For example, you may get results which resemble the
 following:    Having Guids as titles really does not make any sense to
 anyone reading it.  What I like best about this part of the
 configuration is that it demonstrates how flexible SharePoint can be.
 Here, we have a Lotus Notes document which is at best an alien to
 SharePoint. It was created by a completely different organisation (IBM)
 and may be tweaked and customized by Notes developers anyway they deem
 fit. Yet, we can easily configure SharePoint to understand what fields
 the Notes document has. Pretty neat, huh?  The answer lies in the
 Metadata property mappings. You can access the Metadata Property
 Mappings page from SharedServices Administration Page > Search Settings
 > Metadata property mappings.  1. Where is the Title Stored? First,we
 need to take a look at the fields available in our Lotus Notes
 document. Lotus Notes documents stores its Title/Subject in a variety
 of places. To locate the name of the field, we'll have to take a look
 at the document's fields. To do so, simply open the document using the
 Lotus Notes client. Right-click anywhere on the document and select
 Document Properties...  A dialog appears showing the document's
 properties. Look for the field that contain's its title. For example,
 in the diagram below, the field is named Subject    2. Link the
 SharePoint's Title field to the Lotus Notes Document's Title field
 Next, we will use the Metadata property mappings administration page to
 link the document's Title field to SharePoint's Title field.  In the
 Metadata property mappings administration page, click on the managed
 property named Title (you may have to navigate to the second page to
 find it) and select Edit/Map Property.    In the Mappings to crawled
 properties section, click Add Mapping. The Crawled property selection
 dialog appears in a new window.    In the Select Category field, choose
 Notes. Select the property you would like to map to. In our case, we
 will choose the Subject field. Click OK.       Back at the Edit Managed
 Property page, click the Move Up button twice to give the notesfield
 higher priority over the Basic:displaytitle(Text) field. Click OK to
 save the changes.       3. Start a Full Crawl  Finally, start a full
 crawl so that SharePoint and index the new Notes property. After the
 crawl completes, you will find that the correct title now appears in
 the Search results!

Fast-Flux Service Networks I noticed spammers were doing this a few
months ago. I did a reverse DNS lookup on a URL mentioned in spam and
everytime it came back with a different IP hosted on some zombified DSL
connection overseas (tags: zombie dns spam fastflux)




 I've been testing for a while now several of the entries into the home
 server market by Microsoft and several others.    Prior to these
 servers I used a mesh-network of my electronics to distribute and
 access my digital content on all my displays.      Recently though I
 added several connected photo frames that can accept "streamed" content
 that really pushed me to now have all my media content in one location.
 This led me to move all my media that I want connected like photos,
 video, music etc onto these servers as the digital backbone or
 "nucleus" as I like to call it.   I am a strong believer in keeping
 your data network seperate from your media network.   In short that
 means that I would have one network, say 802.11x to let all my machines
 get to the internet for data.   Then a seperate more proprietary
 network that connects my entertainment devices to things like my
 digital nucleus/server or each other.   This way the experience of
 video not skipping or music getting lost, pictures not being delivered
 in full quality will not happen.  Their is a higher level of quality
 assurance in this model where the media network and the data network is
 seperate.      The result now is all the video I create, photos I take
 and music I acquire are all now automatically synced with my storage
 server and readily available to access at any time by my TV's, PC's and
 connected photo frames.      Thus far the experience has been quite
 positive and my assumptions of the importance of a digital nucleus for
 the family or individual has been confirmed.  Wheter that nucleus is
 online, mesh network of devices or a dedicated server is yet to be
 flushed out.   However the option that it is all three is highly
 likely.

The much anticipated and certainly most definitely needed transformation
of the leadership at the CTGOP has begun. With openings all across the
board, and no where for the party to go but up, the next few weeks
should define the next 5 to 10 years of the Republican party as we know
it in Connecticut.  From today's Hartford Courant:  With the resignation
of "Mama Jo" McKenzie and two other GOP stalwarts, Gov. M. Jodi Rell has
the chance to place her stamp directly on the state Republican Party by
filling the organization's most important positions. ... McKenzie's
departure comes at the same time Connecticut's other Republican National
Committee member - Charles Glazer of Greenwich - is stepping down after
being nominated by President Bush as ambassador to El Salvador. ...
[George] Gallo, too, will be leaving soon as the party's chairman, and
he has already accepted a position as chief of staff for the state House
Republicans. But Rell has asked him to remain in the position until a
new leader is selected, which could occur in the coming weeks. He said
it is historic that the three leaders will be replaced virtually
simultaneously.  "These positions are coveted by a lot of our Republican
base," Gallo said. "To have all three of these open at the same time is
a unique situation. It's a unique opportunity for our governor to put a
stamp on Connecticut Republican politics." ... Longtime party insider
Patricia Longo of Wilton is already campaigning for McKenzie's seat,
which must be filled by a woman under the national committee rules
calling for one man and one woman from each state. Longo now serves as
the state party's vice chairwoman, and her elevation would open up
another leadership post to replace her.   Longo should get one of the
RNC spots. She has earned it. The article mentions State Rep. John Frey
as a potential successor to Glazier. I have also heard Chris Healey, who
ran Rob Simmons' campaign and is State Central Committee member, as a
possibility for Glazier's seat but there may be other plans for him.  As
for the Chairmanship; I would personally like to see Simmons get it. As
I have posted on more than one occasion before, his work ethic and
likeablity (amongst many other qualities) would certainly help the state
GOP who despite Gallo's best efforts are in need of a big boost of
energy and make-over. Simmons would provide just that.  Another
possibility is a Simmons/Healey team at the top. If Longo gets the RNC
spot the Vice-Chairman position would open up and Healey could slide
right in. Makes sense as they worked well together on the campaign trail
and share a similar Republican philosophy. I think either option would
be the right medicine for a deathly sick elephant. Only time will tell.
Source: Hartford Courant, January 12, 2007; Rell To Fill GOP Posts,
Christopher Keating On MSNBC today, Republican Presidential candidate
John McCain claimed that Senator Lieberman's defeat of Ned Lamont meant
that the American people were against withdrawal:  Joe Lieberman would
never have been re-elected — a strong proponent of the war — against an
opponent who was for pullout, if that was the American people's
attitude.  TPM Election Central's Eric Kleefeld neatly rips this absurd
argument to shreds (click through to read the whole thing and see the
video of McCain making the claim):  First, let's take a look at
Connecticut's exit polls. They show that sending more troops had the
support of — get this — 15% of voters! Meanwhile, 63% of voters said
some or even all troops should be withdrawn, in complete opposition to
Lieberman's real position.  Second, given the total number of people who
cast their vote for Lieberman, it's nothing short of absurd to say that
it's in any way indicative of anything national. According to the final
results, a total of 563,725 people voted for Lieberman — in other words,
just over half a million in a nation of 300 million people.  Finally,
Lieberman won because he was able to misrepresent his views on Iraq, not
because voters agreed with his actual views on the subject. Back in
July, Lieberman actually said he thought we'd be able to draw down
"significant" numbers of troops by now. What's more, Lieberman worked
hard to blur the line between himself and Ned Lamont on the Iraq issue.
In one ad, for instance, he spoke of wanting to "bring our troops home
from Iraq."   What he said.  Stan Simpson’s column today is already
provoking a lot of outrage and talk around here today, and for good
reason. Here’s the most relevant excerpt: Inviting as it may be, I'm not
joining the piling-on party. When it comes to securing the safety of the
state's highest elected official, you err on the side of caution. No,
Krayeske should not have been arrested, and yes, the charges should be
dropped. But please don't suggest that the guy should not have been
detained for a while, at least until the point police were assured he
had no bad intentions. Certainly, they had a right to inspect the nylon
bag he carried while running along the parade route to make certain
there was nothing more dangerous than a digital camera. [...] I don't
think Krayeske was considered a "threat" in the physical sense, but
someone who may be inclined to try to publicly embarrass the governor on
her big day.  His incident got a mention in Tuesday's New York Times.
Just imagine the news coverage if someone really did slip by security
and harm the 60-year-old grandma in her first elected term.  The
headline: "Where Was Rell's Security?" (Simpson) Security and safety are
gods in America today--and they have been for a long time, even since
before 9/11. We want safer cars, safer schools, safer food, safer air,
safer everything, and we're willing to make monstrous concessions in
order to get them. This is another.  What Stan is suggesting seems so
reasonable. Yes, detain him. Search him. He could have been a threat. He
might have embarrassed or hurt the governor. The security of the state's
chief executive is paramount. He was a known activist, he didn't like
the governor. His bag should have been searched, at the very least. It
would have been okay to hold him until the police were "reassured."  We
can rationalize this, and smother it with the numbing and comforting
"what ifs" that Simpson provides, but a cold truth remains: Ken Krayeske
was arrested because he said the wrong things to the wrong people, and
in the wrong way. Hartford Det. Jeff Antuna wrote in his report that
Krayeske drew his attention by rapidly riding up to the parade route
near Bushnell Park, dumping his bike and running to a position in front
of Rell.  "I immediately recognized the accused as Kenneth Krayeske from
the photograph provided by the state police," Antuna wrote. (Pazniokas)
The state police had his photo because of verbal confrontations between
himself and the governor's staff, regarding his candidate's exclusion
from the gubernatorial debates. This, in Simpson's words, "unsettled"
the state police, and so they provided his photograph to Hartford's
police, and the chain of events was set in motion.  A man was arrested
and detained for hours because of what he said and what he wrote. He was
made known to police because his tone of voice "unsettled" the state
police. He never threatened the governor.  This is not okay.  People can
rationalize just about anything, from strangers rifling through a
woman's purse at the entrance to a ball game to "free speech zones" for
protesters at political events to the arrest and detention of innocent
men if they believe it will make things safer. If you find that fog
clouding your judgement, if you start to think that giving up a little
freedom for security now and then is fine, if you begin to forget that
our entire country is one great big free speech zone, remember what
happened to Ken.  Then imagine it happening to you.  Sources Pazniokas,

 The Dean Dad posted an interesting article about "national service"
 programs yesterday. He's against them, for class reasons:

 The message that national service programs send strikes me as
 dangerous. The implication seems to be that rich kids can just jump
 right into higher ed and start moving up the ladder, but the rest of us
 have to do our time first. It's a sort of penance for not having
 wealthy parents. I know our society worships money, but there should be
 some kind of limits. It implicitly defines higher education as a purely
 private good, which I reject out of hand. (This isn't just the
 perspective of a loony liberal, either. If you've ever been to Chamber
 of Commerce lunches, you know you could start a drinking game based on
 how many times you hear the phrase "educated workforce.") If we're the
 slightest bit serious about economic opportunity, or competing in the
 global economy, or preserving and exploring the cultures of the world,
 or retraining displaced workers, or giving disaffected high school kids
 something to shoot for, or - heaven forbid - fostering creativity for
 its own sake, we shouldn't put up more obstacles to higher ed. We
 should clear them away. If you really want to do a national service,
 improve the high schools.


 He's talking here about a specific variant of "national service"
 proposals, in which high school graduates would do some sort of service
 work for a couple of years before starting college. In exchange for
 this, they would receive college tuition credits. This has never struck
 me as a particularly good variant of the "national service" idea, which
 is itself kind of flawed, but it is one that appeals to a lot of people
 in politics and higher education.  Read the rest of this post... | Read
 the comments on this post...  Margaret Soltan linked to an essay by
 William Deresiewicz, and somehow it got under my skin. I’m having one
 of those weeks where my to-do list is like the hydra, blossoming items
 faster than I can accomplish them, so I don’t really have the energy to
 patiently reply to the Deresiewicz essay itself. It’s a surly little
 essay. Deresiewicz complains that the teenagers have taken over the
 English Department. I don’t accept the complaint, but even if so,
 better that than the kind of prematurely curdled old fartism that he’s
 serving up.  I’ve found some of his commentary in the past better than
 this piece, particularly his interesting essay on the erotics of
 teaching. I think he personally can do better if he wants to complain
 about the state of academic literary criticism, even in a short
 article.  I don’t disagree that English as a discipline (and the
 humanities in general) are in intellectual disarray, and that many
 departments are adrift in terms of where to go next, or how to
 distribute their resources. The answer to that problem has got to be
 something other just turtling back into the high literary canon.
 Deresiewicz arrives at a diagnosis of deep disorder though the usual
 lazy survey of job ads and paper titles. He says he’s “taking the
 temperature” of the field, but you’d know you had a quack for a doctor
 if your doctor took your temperature and diagnosed cancer from that
 alone. You can’t criticize the teaching and publication of a scholar by
 looking at the language of the job ad that led to that scholar being
 hired, but that’s what Deresiewicz does. He compiles a list of fields
 that he finds trendy or worthless merely by name, complains that the
 optional extras at the end of some job ads are intellectually
 incoherent. Oh my no! he exclaims. Someone wants “digital humanities”
 in the English Department, and my god, someone out there is trying to
 hire specialists in science fiction or children’s literature. What have
 we come to? Children’s literature! Like the kind of thing those dreck
 writers Mark Twain and Charles Dickens wrote. Science fiction! How
 ridiculous.  He does admit that most of these ads are attempts to add
 competencies or subjects that aren’t represented in the departments
 which are searching. This might suggest that the writers and subjects
 which he thinks of as core areas of literary competency are still core
 areas. He also knows as well as I do (I hope) that the little laundry
 lists of optional extras at the end of academic job ads are usually a
 political exercise, an accommodation of different pet interests and
 desires among the faculty in any given department. They’re never
 coherent even when they come at the end of an ad which is soberly
 focused on traditional literary subjects in American or British
 literature. Those little sentences often aren’t philosophically or
 theoretically coherent even when they come at the end of a job ad in a
 sober, internally unified discipline like economics or physics. (This
 is why I prefer it when departments write much more minimalist ads,
 even if that often draws a larger pool of applicants.) Deresiewicz
 invokes Gerald Graff at the beginning of his essay. Graff has been very
 sensitive in his writing to the problem of disciplinary and
 epistemological drift in academic curricula. It’s true that the
 humanities have a problem with people who are teaching and researching
 from fundamentally different perspectives who don’t talk to one another
 or bother to try and construct a dialogic relationship between their
 disparate practices, the kind of relationship that is a bridge for
 students who are moving from one classroom to another. The solution to
 that problem isn’t superficial ridicule of a laundry list of topics and
 areas of study: it only makes the problem worse. Why should anyone who
 doesn’t share Deresiewicz’ own practices or interests sit down with him
 to talk about what they do if all he can offer in return is scorn and
 the axiomatic belief that his own interests represent the once and
 future core of a properly composed English Department? (Or in reverse:
 why should someone with Deresiewicz’ interests sit down with someone
 who categorically hates the very idea of the canon?)  If faculty in the
 humanities are drifting away from one another and from any conception
 of a shared discipline, it is precisely because the prospect of sitting
 down to work out a shared vision seems to be full of risk and hassle
 with little prospect of success.


While tracking some of the links relating to the Groovy/Ruby war, I
found this website, which purportedly tracks job trends based on a whole
mess of different job sites.  So, naturally, I had to plug in to get a
graph of C#, C++, Java, Ruby, and VB:








java, c#, c++, ruby, visual basic Job Trends

java jobs - c# jobs - c++ jobs - ruby jobs - visual basic jobs







Interesting. I don't think it proves anything one way or another, mind
you, but interesting nonetheless. Having said that, a few things stand
out to me after looking at this for all of thirty seconds:



Wow, what the hell happened in 1Q and 2Q of 2005? Java takes a huge drop
in 2005, and all of them take a small drop of some form around the same
time in 2006.  What is it with summertime? Did the HR supervisor
suddenly take a look at the company's job board and mutter, "Damn, I
thought we closed all those listings already..."? (Or maybe, "Thank God
for cheap college interns..."?)

C++ jobs still outnumber C# jobs, even in 4Q 2007?

C++ jobs remain essentially flat from 1Q 2005 to 4Q 2007; apparently,
there's a lot more C++ going on than most companies are willing to admit
to.... (Can't you picture it? The nervous candidate, sitting at the
table, as the interviewer shuffles the paper and says, "So, you're here
for a programming job?" The candidate sort of squirms in his chair as he
replies, "Well, actually, I was hoping for a... a... C++ job." The
interviewer quickly looks around to see who might be listening as he
says loudly, "C++? What ever gave you the idea that we do C++ here at
BigCorp?" Meanwhile, he surreptitiously scribbles on the back of a
business card and slides it across the table to the candidate, then
stands up and says loudly, "I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place,
sir. You can see yourself out, I take it?" The candidate palms the card,
and only once has he left the building does he look at the back, which
reads, "8PM, corner of Mission and Vine, password is 'Lippman,
Stroustrup, Sutter, and Meyers!' Viva C++!"...)

VB jobs fall to below C#? So much for those vast hordes of VB
programmers that supposedly form the "long tail" of the .NET
community....

Java jobs remain essentially flat from 1Q 2005 to 4Q 2007, despite
numerous ups and downs. So much for the idea that Java is somehow going
away....

Ruby's penetration into the job market is much smaller than what I would
have guessed.

I couldn't help myself, I did another query with "cobol" added in, but
I'll leave it to you to run your own query to see what that looks like.
It's surprising....


Of course, statistics without any sort of understanding of how they were
gathered or from what sources are essentially meaningless, but ooooh,
it's in color....

details.  Condi Rice thinks Obama's race speech was very important.
Today the Washington Times has published an interview with Condi Rice in
which she says By Nicholas Kralev - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
said yesterday that the United States still has trouble dealing with
race because of a national "birth defect" that denied black Americans
the opportunities given to whites at the country's very founding.
"Black Americans were a founding population," she said. "Africans and
Europeans came here and founded this country together — Europeans by
choice and Africans in chains. That's not a very pretty reality of our
founding."  As a result, Miss Rice told editors and reporters at The
Washington Times, "descendants of slaves did not get much of a head
start, and I think you continue to see some of the effects of that."
"That particular birth defect makes it hard for us to confront it, hard
for us to talk about it, and hard for us to realize that it has
continuing relevance for who we are today," she said.Go read the entire
interview.   This is a statement by the highest ranking African American
in the conservative Republican administration of George Bush, and has
been published in the Washington Times, the Mooney-subsidized
ultra-right-wing Washington newspaper. Condi's interview is important,
the source is important, and the venue of publication will take it to an
audience that represents much of the political opposition to improving
race relations in America.   I knew that Obama's race speech was an
important milestone in America's history of race relations. What I
didn't realize was that it may indicate that America is ready to
rationally discuss how racism infects our society. This goes way beyond
the successes of the Civil Rights Movement is getting the
race-restrictive laws off the American law books. This begins to go to
the very attitudes and behavior that still contaminates America as a
hangover from the attitudes required to hold a substantial portion of
the Southern population in chattel slavery.   America may be ready to
take the next step towards the American ideals of Liberty and Equality
for all Americans. Condi's interview is very important. To find it
published in the Washington Times is, in my opinion, even more
important. It says that White Conservatives are ready to open a
discussion of the problems of race in America instead of just attacking
anyone who dares to bring it up.   This is the America I love. Not
perfect, but striving towards perfection. It is great to see it
happening in public.   It will be very interesting to see if there are
any reported reactions to his interviews, especially from the American
Old South states.  Crews were still looking for the injured from the
collapse of bridge 9340 when the finger pointing of who might be to
blame began.  Former Minnesota Department of Transportation Commissioner
Elwyn Tinklenberg, a Democrat, was on WCCO-AM saying that budget cuts
had curtailed the DOT's ability to do complete bridge inspections.  A
few hours later Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who had
vetoed the transportation bill two years in a row, was telling the media
that the bridge had checked out just fine when inspected in 2005 and
2006.  A MN DOT document from March 2006 indicated that the bridge was
scheduled for repairs in 2006, but it was removed from the schedule
because it would be more efficient to do the work in 2007.  One of the
questions that needs to be answered is if budget constraints were the
cause of delaying the repairs.  If the lack of funding for bridge
repairs and inspections had anything to do with the collapse of the 35W
bridge and the loss of life it caused, it has the potential to be a
political landmine for Governor Pawlenty and those legislators who voted
to support his transportation bill veto.  The cause of the collapse and
the answer to the question "could this have been avoided" make take some
time to determine.   The National Transportation Safety Board has been
called in. There is likely to be investigations on the state level as
well.  Inside Minnesota Politics has obtained the 89-page report of
bridge 9340's inspection in 2001.  In it, there are perhaps some hints
of what may have brought the bridge down.  The report recommended
inspecting certain parts of the bridge every two years as was the
custom.  But it specified the parts that had "high stress ranges" should
be inspected every six months.  What's not known tonight is if those
inspections were carried out as planned, or if budget cuts prevented
them.  The 2001 inspection also noted that "The bridge's deck truss has
not experienced any fatigue cracking, but it has many poor fatigue
details on the main truss and the floor truss system.  The research
helped determine that the fatigue cracking of the deck truss is not
likely, which means the bridge should not have any problems with fatigue
cracking in the foreseeable future." Just a last note form the CeBIT
2007. I made a picture at the stand of MRC, the Mobile Research Center,
Bremen, Germany. This was btw my first intense use of a wearable system.

The job was to answer mathematical and geometrical questions on the left
side and to draw with my hand over a mandrel... On "the left side" means
with a HMD (head mounted display) and a data glove on my left eye and
hand. It was a combination of virtuel and real. And it was f.... hard. I
was fully concentrated on the virtual part so I mostly lost control of
my right hand movements... However, I was 18th of 280 on last monday...

(btw, it's not me at the picture ;-)

Energy is one of the main boundaries for wearable computing. The news
just sounds to amazing to be true: battery power that is woven into
textiles. In other words - I dream about cable-less energy for a long
time now ;-)) Just read:

Enter the nanotechnological battery, the new lightweight and powerful
engine of high-tech dreams, making everything possible from Ball's rope
ascender to hybrid vehicles capable of getting 150 miles per gallon to
battery-powered fabrics that will let soldiers plug electronic devices
into their uniforms.

The really first contact with wearable computing for me was in Zurich,
Switzerland when the Expert from the ETHZ presented his idea for a PHA -
the Personal Health Assistant. Looks like we are a bit closer to that
idea now:

In future, a smart sensor network will monitor sufferers and alert the
doctor when necessary

Six Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany have spent two years working on a
system that can record the main cardiovascular functions 24 hours a day
over a long period of time, even away from the doctor's office, and
enables communication with qualified medical staff.

The technology will be presented at the CeBIT, Fraunhofer, Hall 9, Stand
B36.

It is very fitting that Samsung has called their newest phone the
Access. Since this is Samsung's first foray into ATT territory, the
phone gives special access to a lot of things not seen on other Samsung
phones. <br/><br/>

For example, an Access user has full access to AT&T mobile TV, Video
Share, and Mobile Music. The phone also has other great features, such
as Bluetooth, microSD slot, as well as a 1.3 Megapixel camera with
video. <br/><br/>

So far, there is no word on the price, but the Access is planned to be
released sometime in May. <br/><br/>

This next product is for those who live alone, and don't drink too much
coffee. I am sure that there is an audience for that, and they would
enjoy the Senseo Base HD7810 coffee maker for one.

The Base is simply to use as it makes a single 4 or 8 ounce cup at the
touch of a button. Instead of combining filters and grounds, the user
has to buy "pods" which are pre-packaged filter/ground combos. A user
should use two if he or she wants his or her coffee stronger.

The Senseo Base HD7810 Coffee Maker is available at the Senseo site for
$69.99 in colors of red, white, and black.

	 For anyone who doesn't understand why the national discussion
	 of race needs to address more than just African-American
	 concerns, here's exhibit one, from today's LA Times editorial
	 page:

Are the Tibetans doomed to go the way of the American Indians? Will they
be reduced to being little more than a tourist attraction, peddling
cheap mementos of what was once a great culture? In Tibet itself, that
sad fate is looking more and more likely.

 Of course, the Left is so completely outraged that they'll spend many
 hours directing endless pixels at the LA Times, expressing said
 outrage, no?  Yeah, didn't think so.

 Update:  Other than Susie, who is honorary Abenaki anyway, I've yet to
 see any outrage on the Left over this.  Perhaps if I change the source
 from the LA Times to Senator Hillary Clinton, we'll have 5 million
 comments by this time tomorrow.

 BTW, the author, Ian Buruma, is the Henry R. Luce Professor of Human
 Rights and Journalism at Bard College.  His email is buruma@bard.edu.



 One of my regular correspondents points out that not only the Stop the
 War Coalition will be turning up to Tony Blair's lecture at Westminster
 Cathedral next Thursday. Independent Catholic News reports:

The Catholic peace movement Pax Christi is planning to hold a silent
vigil in the Piazza in front of the Cathedral from 6.30 that evening
(the talk is at 7pm) to call to mind and to public attention, Tony
Blair's involvement in the Iraq War and ongoing occupation, in his
involvement in the decision to replace Trident, as well as other aspects
of his premiership that have created global polarity rather than global
solidarity between peoples.

 This is good of Pax Christi. I too endeavour to draw to public
 attention Tony Blair's role in the Iraq War and the decision to replace
 Trident; it appears I no longer need conduct a vigil about it but can
 do something more convivial that evening.

 The author Geoffrey Wheatcroft, writing in The Guardian about the now
 concluded presidential campaign of Ron Paul, comes up with non sequitur
 of the day: "Anyone dismissing him as rightwing should look at his
 unflinching opposition to the Iraq war, and more generally to the
 foreign policy of George Bush and previous presidents."

 And anyone dismissing Charles Lindbergh as rightwing should look at his
 unflinching opposition to ... well, you can fill in the rest. The
 historical analogy between those personalities, in their views on
 America's role in the world, is close. One of Paul's cheerleaders, the
 stridently unlettered Justin Raimondo, knows little history but is
 voluble nonetheless in his commendation of the isolationism of an
 earlier era. He pointedly refers to "the myth of Japanese war guilt"
 and laments "the ceaseless smearing of the so-called 'isolationists'
 who dared to question Roosevelt's relentless drive to war".

 Of course Paul unflinchingly opposed the Iraq War. He unflinchingly
 opposes US foreign policy tout court, because he is an isolationist -
 and also (as we now know from the researches of Jamie Kirchick at The
 New Republic) a product of an unsavoury nativist tradition on the
 American Right. I can understand the criticism that the Iraq War has
 ruptured America's alliances. But that is not Paul's concern. He is
 opposed to the transatlantic alliance, believing that Nato "should be
 disbanded, the sooner the better". He stands in a foreign policy
 tradition that did enormous damage to the United States and to world
 peace before Presidents F.D. Roosevelt and Truman managed to shift
 American policy towards liberal-democratic internationalism. Had the US
 concerned itself with the European balance of power, and allied early
 enough with Britain and France, then WWI - a catastrophic conflict
 driven by German militarism and imperialism - might have been
 prevented. The victory of American isolationism over Wilsonian
 internationalism in the inter-war years crippled the system of
 collective security that the League of Nations was supposed to
 represent. That isolationist tradition, not excluding its xenophobic
 elements, is where Paul stands. And that's before we consider his
 preposterous notions on economic and social policy (return to the Gold
 Standard, indeed).

 The runner-up for non sequitur of the day, incidentally, also comes
 from Geoffrey Wheatcroft, in the same article: "Unlike some of our own
 'Dr' MPs, Paul is a real physician, serving as a US air force doctor
 before delivering more than 5,000 babies as an obstetrician."

 Let's turn to more substantial matters. John McCain's foreign policy
 speech yesterday to the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles can be
 read here. I have to say I'm impressed. Unlike much of what
 presidential aspirants say about the world, it has meat - such as his
 belief that what is now the G8 should be a club of leading market
 democracies, so including Brazil and India but excluding Russia. What
 he says on, respectively, mending the breaches in the Atlantic alliance
 and standing by our obligations to constitutional authority in Iraq is
 welcome.

 When writing about foreign policy, I'm sometimes accused - especially,
 indeed monotonously, by the people who post comments at "Comment is
 Free" - of being a mouthpiece of the US State Department. This is
 obviously absurd as well as false: I'm far more hawkish than the State
 Department. If you can imagine me writing something like this about the
 Danish cartoons affair, then you misjudge where I stand. (To remind you
 of the contemptible official US response to a campaign of violence,
 arson and intimidation: "The State Department spokesman, Sean
 McCormack, reading the government's statement on the controversy, said,
 'Anti-Muslim images are as unacceptable as anti-Semitic images,' which
 are routinely published in the Arab press, "as anti-Christian images,
 or any other religious belief.'")

 But let me even so direct you to the State Department blog, because it
 has an entry on "public diplomacy" - a subject of great importance to
 the US in sustaining the transatlantic alliance, and thus of great
 importance to us too. The author is a friend of mine, Colleen Graffy,
 who is Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of European
 and Eurasian Affairs. Before she joined the administration, Colleen
 held an academic post in London, and was a frequent guest in broadcast
 discussions about US foreign policy. She took part in a CNN debate on
 this subject with me on one occasion, which is how we met; the
 programme's editor reasonably assumed that a panel including an
 American conservative and a European liberal was as balanced a spread
 of opinion as anyone could wish for.

About Jeremiah Wright, Hillary " Tonya Harding" Clinton had this to say:
"He would not have been my pastor," Clinton said. "You don't choose your
family, but you choose what church you want to attend."
************************************************************  Ahem.
This is what our fellow blogger, Field Negro had to say:  Today again
the "Ice Queen" took a shot at the "O" man and suggested that he should
have left his church. "We don't have a choice when it comes to our
relatives, we have a choice when it comes to our Pastor." Maybe you can
"Ice Queen", but black folks just don't go switching their church. Maybe
that's how you white folks do shit, but religion is personal to black
people. As a black man I take that shit personally when you attack the
black church to make a political point. And when you do it for political
expediency to deflect the news from your own little problems. "Oh stop
it field, you don't even go to church". Yes but I understand that
importance of the church in our community, and, unlike moi, most black
folks do go to church and believe in the institution it represents. So
the longer this shit goes on with the "O" man's pastor, the more upset I
get. If Hillary had a clue she would have left that shit alone. Her
husband is supposed to be the "first black president", they should know
that there are certain things that we hold sacred and just should not be
fucked with.  --------------------------------------------------------
And here is my reply. A reply that goes to heart of why the attacks on
Jeremiah Wright are offensive and personal to Black people.
--------------------------------------------------------  Thank you, FN.
I have been making the rounds of ' MSM' Blogs to make this point.  There
was a Rasmussen Poll done on Wright.  Poll on Wright   Here's the money
section for me:  Overall, voters are evenly divided as to whether Obama
should resign his membership in the Church—42% say that he should while
40% disagree. White voters, by a 46% to 33% margin, say that Obama
should leave the Church. African-American voters, by a 68% to 16%
margin, say he should not. Wright retired last month as Pastor of the
Church.   While there was a 13 point difference FOR among Whites, look
at the gap among Blacks - 52%.  52% AGAINST.   Why?  Church isn't some
simple place where you go on Sunday to listen to the pastor for 30
minutes.  Church, in the Black Community, is all about COMMUNITY.  It's
why, it's literally an all-day affair.  Black people do not change
churches like they do purses. I am in my 30's, and outside of school,
I've had exactly 2 church homes in my life. It took nearly 2 years to
find the second one, but I found it. Commitment to a church isn't
something that's done fly-by-night. It's not some fleeting commitment.
It is a given that you will find something that you don't like about any
church you attend; which is why it is the general COMMUNITY that will
ultimately make that decision.  The Black Church is the ONLY
institution, in the history of The United States of America, which, from
its conception,  Validated, Supported, Incubated, and Treasured.   BLACK
HUMANITY.   Period.  Don't think I'm correct, then name me another
institution which has done so.  The attack on Trinity is seen as an
attack on the Black Church, and thus, by extension, an attack on the
Black Community as a whole.  During times of slavery and Jim Crow, the
Black Church was what reinforced Community.  Post Civil Rights and
Integration, the Black Church is now what brings Community together,
considering that the Black Community, like the rest of America, is
becoming more stratified along the lines of class. The Black Church is
really the only place in Black America where you will consistently find
the doctor and welfare mother in the same building, with the same
purpose. It's the place to break down those walls of class that are
building up.  To disown Wright and Trinity would be to disown the Black
Community itself, which is why Obama said in his speech he couldn't. He
understood that fundamentally about the Black Community, and he
understood that political expediency would mean the doubting of the
existence of his soul by the Black community. Obama would never be
trusted again by Black folk if he had disowned Wright & Trinity. Even
Black folk that don't go to church understand that you don't mess with
the Black Church - it's just not done.   And the Handkerchief Head Mammy
that Clinton has running her campaign KNOWS THIS.



 Democrats in the state Legislature would probably just as soon be rid
 of the sparse number of Republicans that are there--particularly those
 that just tried to squeak-in a pay raise but have seen the vote blocked
 by GOP Leader Bradley Jones.

House Republicans have blocked a Democratic effort to raise the salaries
of members of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, by tucking the extra
dough into the state’s snow and ice removal budget.

 The raises would have doubled the bonus pay for the Revenue Committee
 co-chairs - Sen. Cynthia Creem (D-Newton) and Rep. John Binienda
 (D-Worcester) - and added $7,500 for House vice chairman Rep. William
 Straus’ (D-Mattapoisett) salary.

 The proposed raises were tacked on as an amendment to a supplemental
 budget moving through the House that contained $70.4 million for snow
 and ice removal payments.

 Republican House leader Bradley Jones of North Reading blocked the
 vote, which would have taken place during an informal session with few
 members in the chamber.
Lopsided party representation is never a good thing, especially when
it's Democrats with nearly 90% representation.

 Not that the respective constituents will do anything more than a slap
 on wrist to those Democrats who felt the need to get sneaky.


 Tony Snow Named New White House Press Secretary  Not a big deal
 really…I mean the guy was a broadcaster on the Fox News Network, so it
 would appear that he would fit in quite well with the Bush
 Administration. But check out some quotes by Tony Snow regarding Bush.
 Either the vetting process was incomplete or the Bush Administration
 just gave up on looking for someone who can toe the party line. Check
 this out.   Bush has “lost control of the federal budget and cannot
 resist the temptation to stop raiding the public fisc.” [3/17/06]
 “George W. Bush and his colleagues have become not merely the
 custodians of the largest government in the history of humankind, but
 also exponents of its vigorous expansion.” [3/17/06]    “President Bush
 distilled the essence of his presidency in this year’s State of the
 Union Address: brilliant foreign policy and listless domestic policy.”
 [2/3/06]  “George Bush has become something of an embarrassment.”
 [11/11/05]  Bush “has a habit of singing from the Political Correctness
 hymnal.” [10/7/05]  “No president has looked this impotent this long
 when it comes to defending presidential powers and prerogatives.”
 [9/30/05]  Bush “has given the impression that [he] is more eager to
 please than lead, and that political opponents can get their way if
 they simply dig in their heels and behave like petulant trust-fund
 brats, demanding money and favor — now!” [9/30/05]  “When it comes to
 federal spending, George W. Bush is the boy who can’t say no. In each
 of his three years at the helm, the president has warned Congress to
 restrain its spending appetites, but so far nobody has pushed away from
 the table mainly because the president doesn’t seem to mean what he
 says.” [The Detroit News, 12/28/03]  “The president doesn’t seem to
 give a rip about spending restraint.” [The Detroit News, 12/28/03]
 “Bush, for all his personal appeal, ultimately bolstered his
 detractors’ claims that he didn’t have the drive and work ethic to
 succeed.” [11/16/00]  “Little in the character of demeanor of Al Gore
 or George Bush makes us say to ourselves: Now, this man is truly
 special! Little in our present peace and prosperity impels us to say:
 Give us a great man!” [8/25/00]  “George W. Bush, meanwhile, talks of a
 pillowy America, full of niceness and goodwill. Bush has inherited his
 mother’s attractive feistiness, but he also got his father’s syntax. At
 one point last week, he stunned a friendly audience by barking out
 absurd and inappropriate words, like a soul tortured with Tourette’s.”
 [8/25/00]  “He recently tried to dazzle reporters by discussing the
 vagaries of Congressional Budget Office economic forecasts, but his
 recitation of numbers proved so bewildering that not even his aides
 could produce a comprehensible translation. The English Language has
 become a minefield for the man, whose malaprops make him the political
 heir not of Ronald Reagan, but Norm Crosby.” [8/25/00]  “On the policy
 side, he has become a classical dime-store Democrat. He gladly will
 shovel money into programs that enjoy undeserved prestige, such as Head
 Start. He seems to consider it mean-spirited to shut down programs that
 rip-off taxpayers and mislead supposed beneficiaries.” [8/25/00] The
 Pendulum Has Swung  I have been hoping for this day for quite some
 time. Democrats are once again in a place of power in our government.
 Voters from across the country have said, with a resounding voice, “We
 will not stay the course.” We control the House of Representatives and,
 presumptively, the Senate as well. Things could not be better, save the
 hope of a Democrat taking the White House in 2008. There was some
 exceptional happening this election day…  McCaskill won the Senate seat
 in Missouri…she was the candidate that Michael J. Fox ran TV ads for
 because she supports stem cell research.  The crazy, ultra conservative
 nut job from Pennsylvania, a.k.a. Rick Santorum, got beat by Robert
 Casey Jr.   Nick Lampson beat out Shelley Sekula Gibbs in Tom Delay’s
 old district  Dallas, Texas voters cleaned house in the judicial races,
 replacing 42 GOP judges with 42 Democratic ones…and gave the District
 Attorney’s job to a Democrat  I was at George Hittner’s 4th Annual
 Bi-Partisan Election Night Party this year watching the results roll
 in. I sported my Democratic Donkey cufflinks and got quite a few
 compliments. It was so wonderful to see so many of the gubernatorial,
 Senate and House races be marked up in blue. This is our 1994. This is
 our time. We have a responsibility to take every advantage of this gift
 that the American voters have given us. We need to represent those who
 put us in power AND those who did not. We have to reach out and not
 seek revenge; but seek to lead the American public into a new age of
 peace, prosperity and cooperation. To hell with the rhetoric and
 name-calling. It is time we get off our collective asses, stop whining
 about W and do something worthwhile.  I am waiting for my local party,
 the Harris County Democratic Party, to get their acts together. We
 could have gone the way of Dallas had the Party organized themselves
 appropriately. Instead we chose to whine. We chose to bitch and
 complain. The time for that kind of wasteful energy is gone. We must
 come together and seize the opportunity given to us. If we do not, we
 will be passed by and the people of Houston and Harris County cannot
 afford that.   Here is a complete listing of the results of the 2006
 Midterm Elections.  More Later, Jeffrey Downing
The NYT carries a story about forclosures in a Baltimore neighborhood,
and an outreach program to help people save their homes.  I have quoted
the part that interests me.  Statistics on foreclosure are snapshots of
a moving phenomenon, and data from the state labor department show 174
foreclosures in Belair-Edison last year, while the Community Law Center,
a nonprofit public service group, counted 181; both figures are well
below the more than 275 foreclosures in 2001 and in 2002. Because of a
difference in counting the 2006 figures, the state number represents an
increase in 2007, but a decline over several years. Both agencies
attribute the discrepancy to the inexact nature of counting
foreclosures.  In the foreclosure crisis, lenders and borrowers both say
the other has missed opportunities to save troubled loans. Lenders, who
say they lose tens of thousands of dollars on every foreclosure,
estimate that half of borrowers facing foreclosure never contact their
lender, and many avoid the lender’s calls or letters. In turn, housing
advocates say lenders are reluctant or unable to modify loans. A survey
by Moody’s Investors Service found that 16 large servicers of subprime
mortgages modified only 1 percent of loans that adjusted during three
months studied last year.   “People are calling and they can’t get
through to anyone at the servicer, and time is running out,” Mr. Perez
said.  Both sides are hurt by this impasse.   ...  On a recent Saturday
morning, he led 11 aspiring first-time home buyers in a five-hour
homeownership workshop. If they also attend his one-on-one counseling,
they can qualify for up to $10,000 in public and private aid for down
payments and closing costs.   In private, Mr. Miller talks forcefully
about the predatory loans he has seen in this neighborhood. But to the
class, he took a different tack.   “When people say it’s the banks, or
it’s the lenders, or it’s the real estate agents — it’s not their fault.
You’re the one who said, ‘I want it.’ ” Why Neurodiversity Technically
it's tomorrow, though I haven't slept yet.  My head's rattling, full of
thoughts, so I'm just going to get it down and hopefully my head will be
quiet.  In order to do this right, I have to get very personal and it
might not seem to make sense at first, but I guarantee, I'm getting to
it.  I was a "good" child.  I did well in school, got good grades,
worked hard at a variety of small-scale jobs, and was generally
obedient.  That's why it surprised everyone when I called my house,
talked to my brother, and told him, "I'm going to Milwaukee.  The car
[my dad's car] is at the supermarket.  I'm at the bus station and I've
got to catch my bus.  I love you all." *click*  I don't even think Mark
thought I'd go through with it, though he at least got a warning.  You
see, I lived in southern Minnesota at the time, and Mark was going to
college in Milwaukee.  Had my father had his way, he'd have driven out
there and dragged me back.  But, I was eighteen.  Still going to high
school and still living at home, but eighteen nonetheless.  Luckily, it
was winter break so I didn't miss any school.  All told, I believe I was
gone for a week.  When I came back, Mark and I were engaged.  I asked
him, because he had this pesky rule about knowing someone for five full
months first...and I'm not very patient.  He said 'yes,' which was
mainly a technicality, because we'd been talking about it for quite
awhile.  This was December 1997, and by March 1998 we were married.  A
lot of people were against this.  Not Hatfield and McCoy style, but
against it nonetheless.  You see, Mark was ten years older than me,
hadn't "accomplished" anything, i.e. he wasn't established in a career
(and still isn't), and *gasp* he had a diagnosis of bi-polar disorder.
So, me being the good little girl who had so much to look forward to...
It wasn't the right match.  However, I'm also stubborn.  I follow my
heart.  My heart belong to Mark.  And if that meant flipping off
everyone in both our families...  Luckily it didn't come to that.  We
had our small wedding, despite our families' "better judgement" and we
were together.  We were poor.  We're still poor.  And...I don't regret
it for a moment.  It's been nine years since I made that grandiose
decision in the middle of a Greyhound bus...lets get married, soon!
I've come to realize some of those seemingly friendly words of warning
held something sinister beneath them.  That notion that I was throwing
my life away by marrying Mark was not just my father's silly
thoughts...those same thoughts were going through the heads of some of
his family too.  That's a scary thought for me.  It really is.  While
out of the mouth comes, "You can do anything you set your mind to,"
while at the same time de-valuing him because he had a mental
illness...it makes me shudder.  It makes me hurt.  And it still hurts
and humiliates my husband.  And that just pisses me off.  I recently
learned that one of these "well-meaning" people actually prayed that I
would miscarry our first child together, and that when Willy was
diagnosed with autism that this prayer was somehow justified.  I just
found this out.  And, it's a good thing.  Because, had I known then...
Sometimes my tongue gets away with things it shouldn't.  It can be sharp
as a sword, thrusting true and deep.  There's always fall-out, though,
so I try to keep it under control.  Had I known, I would not have made
any attempt to keep it under control.  Even now, it's hard.  Why
neurodiversity?  Why do I value my children, neither despite nor because
of their autism, but simply because of them?  Why do I value my husband,
neither despite nor because of his bi-polar disorder, but simply because
of him?  Why do I find it so easy to slough off the words of the
"experts" and embrace what I know is true in my heart?  The answer is
simple.  My heart didn't steer me wrong when I got on that bus.  It
isn't steering me wrong now.  I define autism as a human difference, not
a neurological/psychological disorder, because I know that disorder is a
means of de-valuing human beings much to the detriment of the world.  My
husband is a very intelligent, talented man...but something inside him
is shattered, broken and all that talent and all that intelligence is
stuck, trapped by hurtful words and deeds that have broken him down bit
by bit over long periods of time.  I will happily spend a lifetime
helping my husband recover and fly; but I will NOT let my children be
cast aside and trampled upon like their father.  I couldn't save Mark
that horrible injustice, however much I wish I could, but I will save my
children from it.  I've seen prejudice in many forms.  I've seen many
people broken and shattered upon the terrible word, and all that this
word entails.  I don't like prejudice.  I don't like it in any form.
And, I truly believe fighting one form of prejudice is fighting all
forms of prejudice...just a little bit at a time.  This is a worthy
fight.  It's worthy of my energy and my passion.  It's worthy of my
drive.  It's a superior fight to the fight against autism.  I don't want
to fight my kids; I want to help them.  One of the ways I intend to help
them is to pave a way for them, and their father, that is as free of
prejudice as I can possibly manage.  This, for me, is the fight for
neurodiversity -- accepting those who are neurologically different,
diverse as we are to accept all other diversity, with love, compassion,
understanding and accomodation.  If my way of defining and describing
autism seems different than you've ever heard or seen before:  GOOD!!!
I'm not alone in this, but I am willing to be a voice that gets the
attention of those who haven't seen it.  I'm eager to be a voice that
gets some little bit of attention, better for my children to make their
way in this world in their own time.  Better for my husband to make his
way in this world in his own time.  So, yeah, I see things a little
differently than many.  I certainly see things differently than the
medical professionals who deem themselves "experts" of something they
interact with strictly in a trial basis.  I see autism up close, every
day, times three.  I live autism, and I'm glad.  My family is
neurodiverse and I have absolutely no regrets.  (P.S. If any of y'all
want me to do a similar series that is neurodiversity-specific in the
near future, just let me know.) What Autism is NOT Sometimes it helps to
express what one does believe, and sometimes it helps to express what
one does NOT believe. If you express both together, then you're more
likely to be communicating effectively. For autism, I feel it is very
important for me to communicate effectively, because the fate of my
children is wrapped up in how others perceive autism to be. That is
overcomeable, but the difficulties one must overcome when one is
autistic -- mainly attaining enough shared context to interact well --
is enough, the battle for acceptance and understanding is extra weight.
It is this weight I hope to bear for my children, at least as much as I
can.   1) Autism is NOT a disease.    Perhaps that goes without saying,
but now I've said it. I've never heard of anyone excluding an autistic
individual because they were "diseased" or "contagious," which is good,
because they're not. I don't want anyone to start either.  2) Autism is
NOT a demonic possession.  This, unfortunately, does not go without
saying. People believe it, and children die because of it. This isn't
