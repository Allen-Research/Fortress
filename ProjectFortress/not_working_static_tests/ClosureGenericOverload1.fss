(*
This is an expected failure, but it is supposed to report the error
at the appropriate line.  The cause of the error is creation of a closure
(function value) from an overloaded function that includes a generic member.
This is apparently not allowed.  At least one version of the compiler
(around revision 4850) reports this error at the declaration of the
overloaded function, rather than at its use in a closure.
