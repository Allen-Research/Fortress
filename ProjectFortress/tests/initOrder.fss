(* Attempt to reproduce a bizarre bug with initialization order of
classes and operators, which results in "get of unset extends" in
FTraitOrObject. *)

(* Everything must extend this trait, or the bug will disappear. *)

(* Moving this definition down past the definition of object V
   causes the bug to disappear. *)

(* Changing *both* of these to object declarations causes the bug to
   disapper. *)
